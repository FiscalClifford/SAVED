You reach for the lever, and pull it with all your might. With a loud click the mechanism responds to your action, and the tracks move slightly forcing the train to take the divergent path. The train hurtles down the parallel tracks at tremendous speed, but just before it hits the Baron…
Poof!
You blink, and the entire situation has reset itself. The train is right back where it had started, and doesn’t move.
[???] Interesting. You do nothing to save the five people until it involves those which you actually know, in which case you immediately take action to save them. I wonder, did you save them because it was the right thing to do, or because of more selfish reasons? Doesn’t matter, time for the final stage of the trial.
You take a deep breath.
[???] A train is hurtling down the tracks at incredible speed, too fast for the train to be able to brake in time. Tied to the track ahead are your close friends $aName, $liName, $mName, $bardName, and $merchantName.
All five of them appear on the train tracks, and are tied down unable to move. They struggle mightily to free themselves, but can’t move an inch.
[$aName] $pName! What the hell is going on!?
[$liName] You better have a good reason for this you moron!
[$mName] Well this is no joking matter…
[$bardName] AHHH! Help us!
[$merchantName] What the…?
[$pName] You’re repeating yourselves?
[???] There is no longer a divergence, it is only a single path that leads to your friends.
With a poof the divergent tracks turn into dust and float away.
[???] The only way to save your friends is for you to step in front of the train, which will kill you but is also guaranteed to save them. Your death is not as trivial as you think either: by sacrificing yourself to stop this train, not only will you die but I will also destroy your save file so that you may not load your progress back and you will be forced to completely restart.
[$pName] What!?
[???] So, $pName, time for the final decision. Which will you choose?
