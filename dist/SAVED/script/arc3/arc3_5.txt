[$pName] We have two of the greatest Swordswomen in all of $kingdomName. I say we fight them directly like what $liName suggested.
[$liName] For once $pName shows a tiny bit of sense. I’m impressed!
[$pName] Thank… you?
[$aName] If you say so... $liName, let us meditate before the battle. $pName and $mName, try not to get in the way during the fight.
$aName and $liName sit on a couple of boxes next to one of the buildings and close their eyes in preparation. They take deep, purposeful breaths and visualize the battle to come. Meanwhile, $mName fidgets nervously, and after a couple minutes speaks up.
[$mName] Not gonna lie I’m pretty nervous about this... I’ve seen the carnage of battle before; one time I came across a man who had been beheaded and some of his face was even cleaved off.
[$pName] Wow that’s terrible. Sorry man.
[$mName] Do you know what you call someone like him? Someone with no body and no nose?
[$pName] Huh? No, I don’t.
[$mName] Nobody knows.
[$pName] Nobody… wow. WOW.
[$liName] It’s time.
$liName and $aName stride past you, and side by side approach the fortress. Each carries their still sheathed Dragonium alloy blades in their hand instead of their back, and you can see $aName clench and unclench her fist as she walks. You follow behind them in a daze, and realize you can do nothing more than hope for the best. $mName continues to fidget nervously, and fumbles with something in his pocket.
By the time the duo are nearly at the fortress entrance, a guard finally realizes what is going on and rushes up to them.
[Guard] Hey, you again!? Didn’t I tell you to get lost!?
$aName crouches low, and dashes forward without saying a word. In a flash she is upon the guard and the next instant she draws Whisper from her side and slashes horizontally, finally coming to a stop behind the man. He turns to face her and chastise her erratic behavior, but before he can mutter a single a word his torso collapses forwards onto the ground. His disembodied legs stand for a moment longer before finally crumbling backwards, and each half spouts a torrent of blood into the dirt. $liName calmly walks up to rejoin her. $aName shivers almost imperceptibly, and the two advance.
From inside the fort, nobody moves a muscle. At least three other guards that were lounging around were watching the confrontation in boredom, but now after seeing their colleague cleaved into two they don’t move an inch. $liName and $aName have calmly walked to the entrance now, and finally the guards come to their senses.
[Guard] Get… FUCK… DO, Wha… INTRUDER! ATTACKER THE GATES SOMEONE THERES ATTACKERS AT THE GATES!!! SOMEONE STOP THE…
With a whisper of wind $aName’s blade slices clean through the guard’s neck, sending his head flying off to the side.
Finally escaping their stupor, the remaining two guards draw their swords and nervously square off against $aName and $liName. Somewhere in the back of the fortress, a bell rings rapidly.
[Guard] Fuck this! 
One of the guards throws his sword down and sprints back towards the fortress as fast as he can. Once he reaches the fortress doors, he is immediately knocked back by a stampede of soldiers rushing out and is completely trampled by their rush. Meanwhile, his friend who held his ground charges $aName with his sword ready for an overhead strike. Without even blinking $aName simply raises Whisper up to point at him at length and he stops in his tracks. $aName’s blade is so long that he can’t get close without exposing himself, and he hesitates. In that moment of hesitation, $liName marches up behind him and with Gasp still sheathed butts the scabbard into the back of the guard’s legs, sending him stumbling forward onto his knees. Spinning, $liName allows the scabbard to propel itself off the blade and she comes to a full circle, taking off the guard’s head with a clean cut. Meanwhile the scabbard flies away sideways and smashes into an approaching guard’s head, instantly concussing him and leaving him sitting on the ground in a daze.
[$pName] Holy shit…
The pair of brightly dressed women stand menacingly at the entrance to the fort and wait patiently for the reinforcements to arrive. The bell rings desperately now, and all the men who were inside the fort moments ago have finally made it to where the swordswomen wait. Most of them had taken off whatever armor they had in order to relax or eat inside the fort and are clearly unprepared, but all are armed with swords or spears and look ready to fight for their lives.
[$aName] Ok… that’s actually a lot of them. Wow there’s a lot of them. I don’t know $liName maybe we shouldn’t…
[$liName] Just remember to use the entrance to your advantage. If we push too far or retreat too much it’s over. Do you understand?
[$aName] Ahhhh… Ok we can do this…. $pName!?
She calls out over her shoulder back towards you, voice wavering.
[$pName] What?
[$aName] Don’t get too scared ok!?
[$pName] Er… Ok!
The men charge.
There are around 26 in all, just like $liName predicted, and all of them look eager for a fight. After terrorizing helpless peasants for so long they probably had forgotten what a fair fight looked like; $liName and $aName were about to remind them.
[$liName] Now!
The men charge forwards until they get to the wall’s entrance, which immediately bottlenecks them. The first five squeeze past just fine but are quickly cut down by the savage horizontal strikes of $liName and $aName. The next wave after them manages to shove past each other with bloodlust in their eyes and also join the battle, but only after some awkward shoving and tripping. The other 15 or so get stuck trying to rush out of the entrance all at once however and start yelling at each other angrily to move.  Despite all their screaming their progress doesn’t get any better and they get jammed up at the bottleneck. Meanwhile, the first five all lay in the dirt lifeless and the second group starts to get desperate. Switching from targeting $aName to $liName, one of the guards tries to make an unpredictable attack and swings at $liName’s side. Reading his movements just in time, she reaches back behind her and blocks the swing with Gasp before bringing it forwards again in a downward strike. The guard in front of her attempts to block it with a sideways parry, but at the last second she stops the blades movement and leaps forwards and spartan kicks him in the chest. The guard goes flying backwards and tumbles into the group of guards caught up at the entrance, blocking things for them even further. Turning, $liName slices at the man that tried to flank her who blocks the attack with a vertical parry. The guard attempts to lunge at her but $liName leaps backwards, and uses the enormous length of Gasp to stab at him from safety. The guard puts up a few brave efforts to thwart her attacks, but is finally caught in the arm by three quick jabs in succession. Dropping his sword in pain, $liName moves in for the kill and sends Gasp straight through his mouth and out the back of his head.
Only a few feet away, $aName whips her sword around her head in a circular motion, forcing the three guards trying to attack her to back up. Pretending to focus on the guard on her right, she allows her flank to be exposed and lazily tries for a shallow stab. Seeing the opportunity, the guard on her left goes in for a swing, but $aName is ready. Instead of pressing the original attack she brings Whisper back and around towards the left guard and catches him mid thrust. Because of her range advantage she catches him well before he gets too close, and Whisper glides through his sword arm like butter and sends the appendage flying into the air. The middle guard thinks he has an opportunity now and tries to attack as well, but $aName anticipates this and whips Whisper back to the right yet again to fend off his swing. This guard is much more talented than the others, and is quick to get inside her range of attack so that she can’t use Whisper’s length to it’s full potential. The two exchange a series of rapid blows, each struggling to get an advantage on the other. Finally, her opponent slips on the dismembered arm from the left guard and loses his balance. Seeing the opportunity, $aName slashes at his side but he barely manages to deflect it in time. To her left, the guard missing his arm screams in agony and stands there stupidly, staring and clutching at his stump of an arm as it jets blood out and all over the road. $aName hears his screaming and glances in that direction, so the other guard lunges forwards with his sword. Quick as a flash $aName grabs the “unarmed” guard and twists him in front of her so that the attacker’s blade plunges into his chest, finally killing him. Desperately, the aggressor pulls at his sword but it is planted so firmly in his friend that he can’t get it out.
[Guard] Wait, please!
$aName sprints out from behind the impaled guard and with a flourish sends Whisper cascading into the second guard’s shoulder. It slices cleanly straight through all the way down across his chest until hitting the sternum, where it finally stops. The guard looks up at her in amazement, and gasps. Kicking him in the stomach, $aName sends the guard flying backwards and frees her blade from his chest. The lifeless corpse joins a now growing pile at the entrance to the fort, which a few more guards have finally managed to clamber over to join in on the brawl.
On a staircase leading to a platform at the top of the fortress wall, a single guard nocks an arrow to his bow and takes aim. At first he directs the arrow towards $liName, but her movements are so quick and the chance of friendly fire is too great for him to get a good shot. With a grunt, he adjusts his aim further away… Straight at you.
Twang!
The bow’s string lets out a sharp retort as the arrow is loosed, and it flies with perfect accuracy straight towards your chest. By the time you notice the arrow coming towards you, it is already too late to move. But then:
[$mName] Whoop!
$mName jumps in front of you with both of his palms extended outwards, as if he is going to palm strike at the arrow with his left hand. Then just as the arrow looks like it is about to collide with him, it disappears and reappears out of his right palm while carrying its momentum the other direction. The arrow shoots out at rapid speed right back to the sender, and with a thunk collides into the guard’s thigh. Grasping at the shaft of the arrow, the guard falls backwards off the platform and down onto the dirt below.
[$mName] That’s some good ammo for the brag bank right there!
[$pName] Nice save!
Ahead of the two of you, $liName and $aName continue their battle.
With incredible precision, $aName and $liName flourish and swipe their swords around in perfect unison, warding off any and all attacks. As soon as one attacks the other moves to defend her, and as soon as one goes on the defense the other attacks the opponent’s flank. Before long there is a pile of bodies completely blocking the entrance, and unless the remaining guards clamber over the waist high wall of flesh they aren’t able to pass. Finally, only one guard is left fighting while the rest silently watch from behind the wall of bodies. They don’t move, they don’t make a sound. All the bloodlust and gung ho has drained out of them now, and they sullenly watch as $liName ducks under the last combatants swing and dives forwards past the guard. As she flies low to the ground, she brings Gasp across herself sideways and straight through the guard’s legs, taking off both at the knees. The guard triumphantly raises his sword over his head and turns to finish off his opponent who lays on the ground seemingly helpless, but he hadn’t yet noticed neither of his legs are still attached and instead falls pitifully sideways and into the dirt.
[Guard] Wha? WHAT!? AAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
The man screams, screams as hard as he can and drops his sword. Bent over on the ground he clutches at both of his legs and screams over and over again with all his might. His friends watch in silence from behind the wall of bodies as their ally bleeds to death in front of them.
[Guard] AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! MOOOM! MOMMY! PLEASE MOM I DON’T WANT TO DIE! MOTHER…
He flips over onto his stomach and begins crawling towards the town, bawling and screaming. Behind him, a trail of gore is left in his wake. Finally, $aName walks up to him to finish the job.
[Guard] Mother?
$aName sends her blade into his skull, ending his miserable life instantly. Finally, she rejoins $liName at the wall of bodies where the ten or so guards that are left stand quivering in fear.
[$liName] The rest of you, out. NOW.
Desperately, they climb over the bodies and push eachother as they try to escape. They hesitate not a moment as they run past the corpses of their comrades and sprint as hard as they can towards the town. Before long they have disappeared into the woodworks, never to be seen again. $aName looks like she is ready to cry, and a guilty grimace dominates her face. $liName walks up to her and hugs her, whispering reassuring words. After a few minutes of this the two finally break apart, and everyone regroups at the door to the fortress building. Along the way you pick up a sword off of one of the dead guards and strap it to your waist. Despite knowing you wouldn’t really be able to use it, the weight of the blade gives you some comfort.
[$liName] I know that was hard for all of us, but what is done is done. The important thing is that now we can finally talk to the Baron and get a solid lead on the Dragon Cult. Let’s see this through until the end, ok?
[$aName, $pName, $mName] Right.
The three of you open the door to the fortress and step inside. You find yourselves in a large room that serves as some sort of dining area, and it has large tables situated in rows throughout the space. There are lavish rugs across the floor, golden candle holders along the walls, and large ornate tapestries and paintings across every open space. It is one of the most lavish areas you have seen thus far. Speaking of lavish, the tables are covered in dish after dish of savory meats, stews, and bread loafs. In all your time in this world thus far, you have never seen such a wealth of food in one place before.
[$mName] The baron is probably further in…
The four of you venture through the dining hall, where there is not a soul in sight. It is extremely quiet and your footsteps echo uncomfortably loud as you proceed forwards. Finally you reach the back, where there is a small hallway. On the left of the hallway is a closed door, and on the right are steps that must lead to a second floor.
[$liName] I’m thinking we will find him by heading up.
[$mName] I don’t trust staircases.
You look at him in confusion.
[$pName] What? Why?
[$mName] They are always up to something. 
The smack of $liName flicking $mName in the forehead echoes off the walls of the empty dining hall, and the four of you climb the ominous steps.
