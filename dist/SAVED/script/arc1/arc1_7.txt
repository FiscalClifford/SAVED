Leaving the store, you take one last moment to gawk at the sun before settings off. The way the store is positioned by the road, you have to cross a large street before heading for home, and you look both ways before stepping off the curb and onto the asphalt. Suddenly, you feel incredibly off balance and a little nauseous. You stagger and manage to keep your balance, but not without sticking your arms out like a bird and twisting oddly. A feeling of panic creeps up in the back of your mind, this is all happening way too quickly. You glance around yourself, and see turning onto your road is a black sedan with no headlights. You fix your eyes on it, as if this car is the most important thing you have ever witnessed. Gliding along the street, as if in a dream, it veers off course and heads straight towards you. The driver is slumped in their seat as if they were suffering some kind of stroke, but there’s not enough time to inspect any further. You stumble backwards, trying to avoid the vehicle. The dizziness you were experiencing a moment ago at that instant overwhelms you and you fall completely backwards, unable to process what is going on let alone whether or not you can avoid the car. You close your eyes.

A loud rushing sound bursts out, and then a high pitched squeal like something out of an old CRT TV. You feel no impact, despite bracing yourself for it, and it is an agonizingly long amount of time before you finally realize you aren’t dead yet. Oddly, you feel the strong warmth of sunshine on your skin which makes little sense considering the time of day. Perhaps it isn’t sunlight at all but the warmth of your blood, and the pain associated with that blood loss is so extreme you haven’t even felt it yet.
Unable to hold back any longer, you open your eyes, and gasp. What you see boggles the mind.
END OF ARC 1, THE STORE
