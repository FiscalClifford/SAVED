Youâ€™ve always had a problem with being decisive and today is no different. You awkwardly gawk at your choices for what feels like ages, but no matter how hard you think you simply cannot choose between them. You feel the judgmental gaze of the bored cashier burn into the back of your head as you stand staring blankly. You palms begin to sweat. Now you find yourself thinking about how embarrassing the situation is more than you are even thinking about which item you want, and the entire situation is becoming altogether overwhelming. Defeated, you close your eyes and reach out at random and let fate decide. In the end, you grabbed the chocolate. (You realize this is a choose your own adventure game right? Try choosing next time)
