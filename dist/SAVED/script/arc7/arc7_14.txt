You fall to your knees, hopeless.
[$pName] I tried, I really tried… I’m sorry…
[DEATH] One must die. You must Choose.
[$pName] I don’t make this decision lightly. I choose… I choose… $liName.
[$liName] Wha…!?
[$aName] $pName! What are you doing!?
[DEATH] It is done.
DEATH points his finger at $liName and snaps, causing her to freeze in place unable to move. Panicking, her eyes dart back and forth between you and DEATH. She tries to scream but her vocal cords are unable to respond. 
[$aName] Oh no, $liName! Someone do something!
You watch helplessly from the ground and do nothing. They haven’t realized what you have yet, they haven’t realized that the second you met death it was already over.
Grimacing, $aName holds Whisper tightly against herself and sprints forward at incredible speed, determined to protect $liName with everything she has. DEATH readies his sword and blocks her attack, and the two clash back and forth rapidly and with great precision. The sound of their swords clanging against each other rings out and bounces over and over against the icy walls, causing a chorus of battle to echo across the room. Finally, after much struggle, DEATH manages to grab $aName’s arm and throw her with tremendous strength towards the Spire’s wall. Just when it looks like she will smash into it and break every bone in her body Chef jumps in the way and catches her, and the two fly backwards and skid safely along the ground.
[DEATH] The only way to overcome DEATH is to accept its inevitability. Congratulations, you have defeated me.
DEATH strides up to the frozen $liName and with a single thrust impales her through the heart, killing her instantly. With a puff of smoke DEATH vanishes into thin air, and $liName’s corpse falls to the ground unfrozen in time. You crawl up to her.
[$pName] I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…
$aName comes rushing back, and sees you huddling over $liName’s body. Consumed with fury, she pushes you off of her and checks her pulse. When she realizes $liName is gone forever, she curls up in a ball and begins to sob violently. Her wails echo throughout the spire, and you feel numb. A minute passes until she wipes her tears off and angrily stands back up to face you.
[$aName] WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!? IT’S YOUR FAULT!
[$pName] I know…
$aName punches you over and over again in the face, stomach, and anywhere else she can find an opening. You feel no motivation to fight back so you curl up in the fetal position and simply wait for her to tire out. After she finishes giving you a savage beating, you finally sit up and wipe the blood from your face. $aName stares at you in disgust.
[$aName] Why did you choose her? Why did you give up right away? 
[$pName] I DID try $aName, you just couldn’t see it. I tried as hard as I could, I really did. But no matter how long I tried, no matter how much effort I put in, I couldn’t do it. I just couldn’t…
[$aName] What the fuck are you talking about, you asked him to kill $liName right away at the start! Bullshit!
[$pName] You wouldn’t understand…
You become silent, and stare grimly at the ground. $aName glares at you angrily for several minutes without saying a word before finally breaking down and crying again. Her words are choked and you can barely understand her:
[$aName] Why… why didn’t you choose me instead…
An idea flashes across your mind.
[$pName] Wait… Maybe it’s not over yet.
You stand up, and try to pull yourself together. You are pretty beat up but it’s nothing you can’t recover from.
[$pName] I’m just as saddened by $liName’s death as you are, but its not over yet. If the Dragon’s Horsemen of the Apocalypse are guarding this Spire then it’s a sure sign he is at the top. If we manage to beat all four of them, then we can finally meet the Ancient Dragon and get our wishes, right?
$aName looks up at you with tears in her eyes, and nods solemnly.
[$pName] Then it’s simple. We can wish for $liName to be resurrected, good as new. Since It is my fault she died, I will use up my wish to do it. Then when we are done everyone else gets their wish and we can all live happily ever after. Right!?
$aName looks at you confused for a moment, and then her face starts to brighten up as she slowly realizes what you are saying.
[$aName] You’re right… It’s not over yet…
Everyone else has been standing to the side watching this whole time without saying a word, not wanting to interrupt the emotional scene. Finally, $mName decides to pipe in.
[$mName] I agree with $pName, we should power through and bring back $liName. It’s not over yet!
[$bardName] yeah!
[Chef] I Chef Now!
Emboldened, $aName stands back up and recovers herself, wiping her tears off her face completely. She slowly walks over to $liName’s body and closes her eyes before kissing her on the forehead.
[$aName] I’ll save you, I promise!
Everyone groups back up and makes their way to the staircase leading to the next floor. Through the windows along the wall you can see that far below you now the snow glistens in the sun and the wintery countryside glows beautifully. It’s a tender sight, but one you can’t enjoy for long. You brave the stairs upwards, and prepare for the next battle.
