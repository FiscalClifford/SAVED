[WAR] Didn’t scare you off huh? Typical of CONQUEST I suppose. Oh, you didn’t know? I am the last horseman standing between you and the Ancient Dragon. Our world’s last hope. The fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse, CONQUEST, isn’t waiting on the floor above us. CONQUEST is you. We each have our powers; DEATH can kill anyone, FAMINE can eat memories, and I can engage in warfare in unprecedented ways. But none of us can compare to you CONQUEST. The Dragon gave you the power to save and load, and an unquenchable thirst for death and drama. How fitting. Out of all of us, you are the only one I truly fear.
[$realName] DIE.
You plunge your sword into WAR’s stomach, and it stabs straight through him like a hot knife through butter. WAR gasps in pain, and grips onto your collar ineffectively. Tears run down his face.
[WAR] I tried, I really did… I’m sorry everyone. I have failed… I’m so sorry…
You pull the sword from WAR’s stomach and he collapses onto the floor feebly trying to stop his insides from spilling out of the wound. He is dying slowly and painfully, and it will be some time before the stomach acid escaping through the hole you just created eats through his organs and his body shuts down. You could stab him through the heart, and end his misery of course… but you don’t. Instead, you head for the next flight of stairs at the far side of the room and begin to head upwards. There can only be one thing at the top of the spire now: The Ancient Dragon. You are finally here.
