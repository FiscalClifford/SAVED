You climb the stairs as quickly as you can, and after a considerable amount of effort you reach the top huffing and puffing. You find yourself in a new room nearly identical to the last, except here the ceiling is even higher than the last one which gives it a very spacious feeling. The ice on the floor is grooved and scratched up so that it is relatively grippy, but you still slide a little bit while walking on it. At the far side of the room is another figure, this one stranger looking than the last.
[$pName] Another Horseman of the Apocalypse. Let’s go guys.
As you move forward so does the figure, and the two of you meet in the middle about 20 feet apart. Now that you are closer, you are surprised by his grandeur appearance in Contrast with DEATH.
The man wears a huge fuzzy red wizards robe with sleeves that extend all the way to the ground and drag behind him when he walks. The collar of his robe is so comically large that it sticks straight up and out several feet, and has a taper to it so that it looks like a pair of dragon’s wings. Across his chest is a gargantuan golden amulet depicting a dragon’s head, snarling menacingly. The amulet is so big it covers much of his upper torso and looks like it must weigh a hundred pounds, but the man does not strain under its weight. He looks like a man in his late fifties with greying hair and is clean shaven. His eyes are yellow and strange to look at, and you feel more and more uneasy the longer you look at him. This is probably because he never blinks and only stares at you like a starving man looking at his first meal in weeks. He relaxes his jaw at all times so you can see where streaks of drool have dripped from his mouth and fallen down across his robe and amulet.
[???] And here you are, $pName. I’ve been waiting for you. I am none other than FAMINE, and it is my holy duty to prevent your progress up this Spire. Are you prepared to confess your sins?
His voice doesn’t match his face at all, and sounds like a prepubescent teen that has been drinking too much caffeine. It immediately annoys you.
[$pName] Shut up FAMINE, let’s get this over with.
[FAMINE] Woah! So hasty! I cannot, will not, shall not let you treat me like that! You know, when WAR told me of how you chose this route, I was so disappointed. He gets to be the bad guy in this one while I sit on the sidelines, such a bore! He doesn’t even fight you properly, he just used that damn mercenary. What a cheat, what a scumbag, what a drag! But last time, or maybe next time, or maybe last next time, we will become VERY well acquainted. I look forward to it.
[$pName] What the hell are you going on about?
[FAMINE] Oooooohhhh deary me oh me oh my, I am so famished, so hungry, so starving! I could really go for a good meal right now. Let’s see here… Oh my $pName you shouldn’t have! You brought this all the way over here FOR ME!? So kind, so loving, so gracious!
Suddenly, you feel like you’ve been punched in the gut. Something terrible just happened, but you don’t know what it is. You feel extremely… vulnerable.
