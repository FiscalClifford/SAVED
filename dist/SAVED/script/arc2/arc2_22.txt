[$pName] I’m a believer
The woman wags her finger at you and says with a scolding tone
[woman] devout misters like yerself aughta be more careful ‘bout these kinda things. I ‘ere that the Ancient Dragon’ll come an chew ya up if ya aint careful. 
She makes a finger waggling motion across her chest at the word ‘dragon’

With that she makes her way over to the box, and leans down to grab a couple of potatoes. Spitting on one, she rubs the top and makes her way back to the staircase she had just come down from. Along the way she tosses the second one to you, which you fail to catch and it fumbles to the floor. Upon hitting the ground it splits in half, and you quickly stoop over to shove one of the halves into your pocket just in case you need it later. You hear the munching of her eating the potato she grabbed raw as she ascends the steps of the rickety house, and the creaking of the wooden planks signifies their strain under her insignificant weight. You decide it is time to leave and make your way back down, being just as careful on the descent. Once you get to the bottom you exit through the door and find yourself right back on the dirt road again.
