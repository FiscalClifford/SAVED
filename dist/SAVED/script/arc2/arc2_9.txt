The History Room is a good place to deepen your understanding of where you are and what is going on. Before you enter you notice a muddy device that looks like a beartrap resting in front of the door, except instead of metal fangs it has thick bristles. You politely run your shoes through it and manage to remove most of the mud that has accumulated then make your way inside.
You are inside an extremely cramped hallway, with another door only a few feet in front of you. To your left is a wall with some small drawings scattered about it that look to have been made by children, and to your right is a counter at about waist height. There is a box with some copper coins behind the counter on the shelf, and there is nobody standing there although it looks like there clearly should be. There is a closed door behind the counter that must lead to some kind of backroom, and you can hear shuffling as if someone was moving things. You glance at the door that surely leads to the history room, and notice it is slightly ajar.
