You make your way to the central plaza, trying to step around the piles of filth pooling haphazardly around the road. The closer you get, the nicer the buildings become and it looks like someone poured gravel across the pathway so it is at least somewhat sturdier and better kept than before. Finally, you enter the wide-open plaza and soak in everything as best you can. The scene is entirely alien; there are no electrical poles, concrete roads, or glass windows within sight. The plaza itself is paved with slabs of stone, but there is little to no mortar between them so many jut out callously from the dirt and threaten a twisted ankle. The square is about half the size of a soccer field and surrounded at all sides by stone buildings. From these buildings crude wooden signs jut out like pointing fingers, advertising a variety of goods such as food, clothing, armor, ale, weapons, boots, prostitution, and more. Scattered about the plaza are a large gathering of rickety stalls where merchants sell assorted wares, snacks, and… Spellbooks? The people you pass along the way wear either clothing similar to the potato sacks you had seen earlier, or a colorful assortment of felt tunics and leather gear. Several of the wealthier looking shoppers look like they wear that same burlap sack underneath their garments or have a patch of burlap sown onto their clothing somewhere. Wandering about the plaza, two more buildings catch your eye: One labeled ‘History room’ and another labeled ‘Adventurer’s Gear’. Both have plain entrances but the title is enough to pique your interest. Just when you think everything there is to notice has been noted, another interesting development occurs. You see a confident looking woman in a yellow dress with a large, thin sword strapped to her back. There is a woman escorting the girl in the yellow dress as well, and interestingly she is wearing exactly the same dress in almost every way except it is the color lavender instead of yellow. The pair walk around for a while you stare stupidly, until they happen upon the spell book merchant you noticed earlier. The woman in yellow seems to get excited, and chats about something with the shopkeeper for quite a while. Eventually she hangs her head a little in disappointment, and the pair resume their browsing. Once they have looked at all the stalls they head off the plaza, perpendicular to the road you had come in on. It looks like they will eventually pass some kind of church, and you can barely see the top of the steeple from where you stand.
