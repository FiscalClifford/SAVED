Walking along the winding sidepath, you make sure to hop nimbly over the rancid puddles in the mud in an effort to avoid soiling all your shoes. Curiously, almost all of the buildings on your left are rickety wooden shacks, lean-tos, or mud huts, and save for a few exceptions all the buildings on your right are better made wooden houses, some even with additions jutting out or second stories. Most of the people you see as you walk along are peeking out of the holes in their shacks on the left, and without fail they are dirty, sweaty, and wear a burlap potato sack as their only clothing. Many are snacking on raw potatoes, and a couple spit out dirt straight towards your feet as you walk past. Something about you insults them.
Eventually you come across a decrepit house, and this one is stands out from the rest because the flimsy wooden structure juts out three stories tall. From the 3rd floor, a dirty woman with a nasty looking boil on her nose leans out from a window and calls to you
[woman] Ya better come in ‘ere quick mister ‘fore you start a fight!
Without looking to see your response, she ducks back into the window and disappears from view. Glancing around warily, you notice that opposite the 3 story house is a stout looking wooden building that says ‘tavern’ on sign fixed to the front of the roof. It has no windows and a small porch where you can wipe the mud off your shoes. At the far left of the porch and away from the entryway is a lone man with brown felt pants, a black shirt, and a vest worn over the shirt made of brown burlap. He is smoking a long cigar and staring right back at you. Breaking eye contact, you glance back at the 3 story building and figure out your next move.
