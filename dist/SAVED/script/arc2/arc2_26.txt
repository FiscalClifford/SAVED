You continue along the winding road which continues swerving between buildings until you find yourself in the southwestern part of town. You spend most of this journey soaking up the cheerful sunshine and studying the swarms of curious looking people going about their day. Suddenly, the path stops at the rear entrance to some kind of shop, and you find that you will have to go around the shop through an alleyway to progress. Hearing the hubbub of a busy road up ahead, you start into the alleyway and freeze.
[???] Wah hoh there! Ah strange lookin stranger striding sulkily…
A silhouette emerges from around the corner ahead and hobbles in front of you. The shadow of the buildings on the either side of the alleyway darken the person’s features, giving them a foreboding look. With a short hop, the figure draws within 15 feet of you and points a broken dagger straight at your chest.
[Man] Aureus! Give it tah me! Stop stalling and slip it ovah!
The Man wears a filthy burlap sack which drapes loosely over his wire thin body. An exceptionally long grey beard hangs like spiderwebs from his skeletal looking face, which is wrinkled up like a prune. A burlap cap struggles to keep purchase on his grey hair, which looks like it is falling out in disgusting clumps every so often. His belly sticks out grotesquely as if he was pregnant, and overall his appearance is strikingly disgusting.
