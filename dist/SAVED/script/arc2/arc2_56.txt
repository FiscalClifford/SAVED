The darkness clouding your mind slowly lifts, and the rushing sound of static overwhelms your senses before suddenly stopping all at once. Your eyes shoot open, and with a start you sit upright. As quickly as you can you feel all over your head, checking for the shaft of an arrow where it must surely protrude from your skull. After several desperate seconds you find nothing, and you take a deep breath. The sound of nails on chalkboard rings in the back of your head as you slowly stand up. Knees wobbling, you unsteadily rise to your feet and try to get a hold of yourself. You still have time, you reflect, time to do things differently.
