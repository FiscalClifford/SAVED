You wander around the town for the next several hours, until you feel pretty familiar with the area. Wandering to the north you pass dozens of craftsmen working in their lodges, working leather or pounding metal into numerous shapes. Further on the felters beat bales of wool furiously in an effort to make it workable for weavers to make garments, and cobblers carefully stitch leather together to make fine pairs of boots. After exploring a bit more the sun has set enough for you to know which direction west is, and you realize you haven’t gone to that section of town yet so you head over. The western area is opposite where you started, and has hundreds of shacks filled with potatoes mixed in with the mud huts that people live in. From the edge of the town you gaze towards the sunset, and below that burning orb of light are potato fields stretching away as far as the eye can see. Other than a few dozen people checking on the crops there isn’t much to see, so you start strolling towards the southern end of town. Along the way you can’t resist the hunger pangs anymore and eat the $food you had been saving all this time. At the southern end is mostly nicer residentials, and there are shops propped up against the houses here and there implying the inhabitants sell trinkets out of their front door. There is significantly more road traffic here as many people walk along the main south road and a few carts pulled by horses amble past filled with miscellaneous goods. A little later you happen across a shrine, where a perfectly spherical orb of polished stone rests. The orb is slightly taller than you, and is so perfectly round and polished it can’t possibly be handmade. Below the orb is a plaque reading ‘Serius’ last stand.’ You lean against a tree next to the orb resting for a while, gathering your thoughts. After a while of simply watching the inhabitants of Kingsbridge pass by, the sun begins to set. You will have to either find a place to hunker down in the town for the night or leave before it gets too dark to see where you are going.
