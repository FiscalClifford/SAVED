You exit the Gear shop through the door you came in, and return to the plaza. Window shopping is no fun when you have no money to buy anything, and as time passes more and more you realize you will eventually have to figure out a way to pay for dinner despite being broke. Luckily you still have the $food in your pocket from before but that certainly wonâ€™t be a satisfying meal. As you take a couple steps into the plaza to browse around some more your eyes are drawn to yet another very unique looking person; a confident looking woman in a yellow dress with a large, thin sword strapped to her back. There is a woman escorting the girl in the yellow dress as well, and interestingly she is wearing exactly the same dress in almost every way except it is the color lavender instead of yellow. The pair walk around for a while you stare stupidly, until they happen upon the spell book merchant you noticed earlier. The woman in yellow seems to get excited, and chats about something with the shopkeeper for quite a while. Eventually she hangs her head a little in disappointment, and the pair resume their browsing. Once they have looked at all the stalls they head off the plaza, perpendicular to the road you had come in on. It looks like they will eventually pass some kind of church, and you can barely see the top of the steeple from where you stand.
