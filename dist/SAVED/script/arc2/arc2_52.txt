The darkness clouding your mind slowly lifts, and the rushing sound of static overwhelms your senses before suddenly stopping all at once. Your eyes shoot open, and with a start you sit upright. In a panic, you clutch at your stomach but it no longer aches, and in disbelief you realize that your muscles are back and you aren’t skin and bones anymore. You shiver remembering the cold you felt only moments ago, but now it is completely gone. You slowly rise to your feet, and are amazed to find that your old strength has returned to you. It’s as if your lonely days as a peasant have been completely undone! Perhaps this time, you reflect, I will be able to do things differently.
