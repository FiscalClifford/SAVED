A bit of time has passed since you came face to face with perhaps the three most unique people in the entire town. Since then the four of you decided to escape the shadows of the alleyway and sit at a table in a nearby tavern. Outside, the sun sets peacefully sending a cascade of alluring orange rays through the clouds and countryside. Inside the tavern, the only orange light to be seen is from the multitude of candles hung along the walls and on every table. The tavern itself is quite cozy, with an open space in the middle for restless drinkers and small booths along each wall where patrons can chat in private. The four of you sit in such a booth, with the yellow and lavender girls sitting next to eachother and you across from them. The wall is on your right, and to your left is the swordswoman in the white cloak, who had pulled up a chair and sits perpendicular to you and the girls. She drinks a mug of beer the pair had bought her as thanks for her help and sits back in her chair relaxed and with her legs crossed.  
The woman in White is just as unique as the two sitting across from you; She is in her late 20’s and brims confidence and grace like you’ve never seen. She has $bHairColor hair, $bSkinColor skin and while her facial features are plain, her face is so perfectly symmetrical that you can’t help but be mesmerized by her unconventional beauty. The only thing about her that doesn’t match the perfect symmetry is a small mole on the right side of her chin. She wears a sturdy leather cuirass etched with countless markings of battle, bracers, and greaves with black clothing underneath. All over her limbs are large rings of bronze which wrap around the arm or leg, and probably serve as metal guards against slashing attacks. She wears a large cloak of pure white, with a golden crest of a wolf at the back. The bottom of the cape is stained with dirt and dried blood from years of use and action. The cloak wraps around in front of her and over her chest, secured by a final bronze ring that has three thin but long ribbons of burlap hanging from it. At her hip is a longsword in a black sheathe that is razor sharp, as the late mugger can attest.
Not nearly as relaxed as she however are the two across from you, who are eager to get the questioning started. First up is the one in Lavender, who pushes her hair behind her ear in a fluid motion and leans forward slightly as she talks.
[Woman in Lavender] At first I thought you planned an ambush with that mugger, only you didn’t run away after he was slain. So if you weren’t in cahoots with him to steal from us, what the heck are you playing at?
