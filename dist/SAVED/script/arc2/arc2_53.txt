The darkness clouding your mind slowly lifts, and the rushing sound of static overwhelms your senses before suddenly stopping all at once. Your eyes shoot open, and with a start you sit upright. Desperately you grasp at your chest where mere moments ago an arrow was protruding out of it, but feel nothing. It is as if you had never been hurt at all. You take a big, thankful breath of fresh and appreciate that both of your lungs are in working order before standing up. You still have time, you reflect, time to do things differently.
