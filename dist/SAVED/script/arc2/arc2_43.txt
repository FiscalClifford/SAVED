[$pName] Uh, yeah. That’s me.
[Man] Ya Kingsbridge folk may not take the workday seriously, but we do things differently here at Dottle. First thing’s first, you gotta start showin’ up here in tah morning like yer supposed tah instead of randomly in tah evenin’.
[$pName] Got it.
[Man] Secondly, ya get paid at tah end of every week for this project at the agreed amount. As long as ya do yer job right it doesn’t lower, but just ‘cause yer in charge of tah woodworkin’ team doesn’t mean ya can haggle on yer pay halfway through aight?
[$pName] Sure thing.
[man] lastly, where tah heck are yer tools?
[$pName] Well, I’m in charge right? The only tool a good leader needs is right here.
You point at your head as if it is the most obvious thing in the world. The man looks at you like you are truly an idiot for a moment before quickly masking his expression with a cheesy smile.
[Man] Welcome aboard then! We’re just now wrappin’ up but I look forward tah seein’ how ya perform tomorrah.

And just like that, your career as woodworking lead began. The first week of work was the hardest; you slept outside in the cold and knew very little about what the job was supposed to be. Luckily, the carpenters working for you were very kind and shared everything you needed to know as the work progressed. To be honest they probably were just relieved they didn’t get a hard ass in charge and despite knowing you had no idea what you were doing they allowed you to stay anyways. After the first week you got paid, and used the money to pay for renting a tiny but well made cottage. Before long you didn’t have to eat the charity potatoes the church offered each week anymore, and could afford to buy half decent food. In this way you slowly managed to make a decent living for yourself in the peaceful town of Dottle. Eventually a year passes, and by this time you are pretty decent at your job and respected in the community. You get a lot of teasing for having a weird accent, but nobody suspects or questions your true origins. 
One day, a woman arrives in town wearing tattered clothing and looking to be on the brink of starvation. She begs around town for a while before you finally come across her, and as soon as your eyes meet you are shocked at the face you find oddly familiar; it is the Carpenter’s old wife. You offer her a temporary place to stay, and in gratitude she starts buying yarn, weaving it into hats, and selling them to the many travelers passing through to buy horses. Eventually she makes enough to pay for her share of the rent, and she even helps keep the cottage tidy. She doesn’t say anything at first, but after a week of silence she finally breaks down into tears and tells her story.
The carpenter’s body was found in the forest a day after she met you, and apparently it was pretty gruesome. She fell into depression for a long time after that, and since she lived by herself she was rarely bothered. After making it through winter, she realized she wouldn’t have enough money to survive for much longer and decided to sell the house, the shed, the tools, everything. People were creeped out about the carpenter’s unsolved death and figured the forest was haunted, so she didn’t get very much for it. She buried most of the money in her husband’s grave, and decided to wander the countryside looking for a new life. Eventually, she found you, and is grateful to be given a second chance. 
You swallow your guilt at having stolen her late husband’s identity in order to live the way you do now, and say nothing.
And so the two of you live together as friends for many years, and while you are often criticized for completing projects behind schedule your workers always enjoy your leadership and employment. 3 decades pass, and your dear friend dies. As she lies on her deathbed you finally confess your identity theft, and with a kind smile she forgives you. The next morning, she is gone.
You continue as head of woodworking for many more years, despite your joints getting stiffer and back complaining incessantly. You never marry, but make many dear friends along the way. Eventually you become very sick, and because of your age and lack of any modern medicine you know you have little time left. Surrounded by friends, you thank each of them for the time you have shared together building up the little town of Dottle, which by now has become a small city. Everyone takes their turn to hold your hand and encourage you, until eventually you are left all alone. Coughing violently, you feel very tired. It is time. With a final grin at all you have accomplished, you take your last breath, and pass peacefully in your bed.
THE END.
