The Die has been cast.
[$pName] No offense to you two, but I’m going to stick with $bName.
[$aName] WHAT!?!?
$aName slams her hands on the table, immediately standing up and sending $bName’s beer toppling over.
[$aName] BASED ON WHAT!? 
[$liName] $aName! Calm down!
$liName roughly grabs $aName’s dress and pulls her back into her seat. A few patrons around the tavern glance over at the commotion, but once they see there isn’t a fight happening they become disinterested and look away.
[$aName] Ok whatever, but how about you sell us the magic Dragon locator? I’ll pay good money for it…
[$bName] Enough. Without that locator $pName is useless to me, and besides only people from $pLocation would be able to us it to locate the dragon anyways. Respect his decision and leave us.
$aName and $liName begrudgingly leave their seats, and looking back over her shoulder $aName gets her last word in:
[$aName] I should never have offered you a spot in our group $bName, you never would have fit in. And as for you $pName… well good luck dealing with her. You’ll need it.
The two stunning women gather their things, adjust their swords, and storm out of the door. 
[$bName] They aren’t wrong you know. I haven’t travelled with anyone in a long time and I’ve heard  I’m not the easiest travel buddy. I guess my biggest advice for you is don’t say or do anything stupid and we can get along fine.
You gulp.
[$bName] … I stopped in Kingsbridge to buy a backup dagger since my old one is falling apart, and before you ask no you cannot have it. I wasn’t intending on staying here for this long however, and want to at least head further east past Dottle where there are less people with prying eyes.
She stands up, gathering herself and preparing to leave. You follow suit, and grab one last piece of cheese off the table to snack on before heading out the front entrance.
[$bName] They raise horses near Dottle and I was hoping to get one this evening, but looks like it will be dark in only a few moments. I’ll get one tomorrow morning and then we will officially begin our journey together.
[$pName] You mean you will be getting two horses right? It would be a little demeaning walking next to you while you ride along…
$bName stares at you blankly, and says nothing. You take the hint, and shut your mouth. The two of you head for the plaza, and carefully make your way across the uneven stones. Turning right you begin heading east, and in the dim light you can barely recognize some of the buildings you had passed by earlier. Eventually the two of you finally exit the town and stroll along the dirt pathway, saying nothing. $bName walks with her head held high and her chest out, and her excellent posture makes her seem like the most confident person in the world.
[$pName] So… You have been travelling alone for a long time then?
$bName keeps her eye on the path ahead of her, and without turning to look at you replies:
[$bName] It’s a long story, and probably not worth sharing.
[$pName] It isn’t as if we were doing something else more important. I’m all ears.
$bName sighs and looks up at the sky, which is starting to get properly dark now. The first few stars of the night wink down on her, and the moon meagerly begins to light the waving fields of tall grass around the two of you. The sound of the wind caressing the foliage is soothing and familiar.
[$bName] Like I said, I was born in $bLocation. I was an only child, and my mother died giving birth to me so I never knew her. My dad said she looked just like me though and was a gentle spirit.
$bName briefly touches her mole before continuing. At this point she is lost in the memories.
[$bName] My dad was a swordsmith in $bLocation, but not very talented. The job was mostly just so that he could make new swords to practice with, which was his real passion. Ever since I was young he trained me to be a swordswoman, and he insisted that as long as I practiced enough I could beat anyone with a blade. One day when I was about 16 the King requested he join the army in order to make weapons for him, and I never heard or saw him again. Knowing him, he probably got overzealous and tried to join in on a battle. Old fool.
The moonlight plays off her lips, which form into a slight smile. The pair of you make it to the brook, and while you can tell she has more to say she decides to take a break and wordlessly washes her hands and face in the water. You follow suit, and after becoming sufficiently refreshed the two of you continue east along the path.

[$bName] I stayed in town forging weapons, but hated it the whole time. The only thing I ever really enjoyed was my father’s practice drills, but sword fighting doesn’t make much money in a town without conflict. At about 22 I decided I had enough of waiting for my father to return and traveled south to the border. Mercenary gangs were at their peak back then and one of them, the wild wolves…
She juts out her thumb towards her back, pointing at the cloak
[$bName] Took me in eagerly. Their specialty was skirmishing and flanking maneuvers with sword wielding warriors. I fought with them for the next two years, eventually becoming a squad leader and taking part in many battles. I’ve fought on the King’s side, and I fought for $neighborName too. As long as they financed my efforts I didn’t care. Eventually some court official of $neighborName noticed my skill and employed me as a personal bodyguard. So that’s what I did for another couple years until we got caught in an ambush and my employer was killed. People don’t particularly like employing bodyguards that had their VIP killed so I had no choice but to return home with all the savings I had accumulated. When I returned, I was shocked: Half the town was starving. The war had taken its toll even on communities as far away from the frontlines as $bLocation, and the King’s heavy taxation bled it dry of funds. I decided then and there I wouldn’t fight as a mercenary ever again.
$bName sighs loudly, and brings her hands together behind her head.
[$bName] Ever since then, which would be around 3 years ago, I have explored around the world looking for the Ancient Dragon and my magical fruit.
You glance at her hands but she doesn’t do the waggle thing.
[$bName] I’m starting to think that neither is real, but seeing the world is nice and I have plenty of money saved up from my old fighting days. It’s better than smithing, that’s for sure.
$bName has probably said more words in the last 10 minutes than she has said in the last 10 months, so you give her a rest and enjoy the ambiance of the moonlit countryside. Soon, you pass the wooden sign where you woke up before, and with a groan realize you still have another 14 miles or kilometers or whatever unit of distance they use here to go.
Ahead Looms the Oak Tree.
Just when you think $bName is going to lapse into silence for the rest of the trip, her face scrunches up in concentration and speaks again, only now with her voice raised.
[$bName] Was it enjoyable to get to know me so quickly? Do you feel like you know me well now?
She turns her head to look over at you and the moonlight reflects off her narrowed eyes. Her left hand rests on the pommel of her sword and her right hand is clenched into a fist.
[$bName] What If I told you that was all a lie? That everything I just told you is a practiced story I have used on countless people so that they would feel like they knew and trusted me? Would you believe me?
She stops walking, and faces you entirely. You freeze, and feel like you can’t move an inch. Not far ahead, the leaves of the oak tree rustle in the wind. $bName’s head perks up slightly, as if she heard or sensed something you couldn’t. She glares at you with a scowl.
[$bName] I know you have been lying about why you are here. I know you are lying about what your motivations are. And worst of all, I know about this little trap you have set up.
In a smooth motion $bName draws her blade and lunges towards you. Before you can react she pierces your foot, sending a stabbing pain shooting through your leg. In disbelief, you fall over helplessly and clutch at your foot which is now oozing blood into your shoe.
[$bName] Stay right there little duckling, after I take care of your associate, I’ll interrogate you next.
Blade drawn, cloak billowing in the wind, $bName marches towards The Oak Tree. From the ground you watch helplessly and in utter confusion. Then, every couple of seconds you start to hear a strange sound.
wheeow, ting!
wheeeeeow, clang!
It’s hard to see in the moonlight, but $bName is marching towards the Oak Tree and swinging her sword wildly every few seconds. Finally, you realize what the noise is coming from: it is the shrill hiss of an arrow being fired and travelling through the air. Every couple of seconds, someone from the branches of the oak tree is launching an arrow towards $bName, and every time the arrow is launched she swiftly deflects it with her sword. But she isn’t able to block them all, and finally she misses one and it hits her armored chest with a loud Thud. She stumbles for a half second, recomposes herself and continues with a grimace.
wheeow, ping!
She deflects another arrow, to have such reaction speed is seemingly unhuman.
wheeow, Shrick!
She is right below the tree now and simply cannot react in time to block the arrow. Shielding her face, the arrow shoots straight through the bracer on her arm and cleanly flies into her chest to join the first. Because it lost so much speed penetrating her arm, it bounces off the armor but in its wake is a trail of blood pouring out of $bName’s arm. Yelling in pain and frustration now, $bName approaches the base of the tree. From above, the attacker continues to rain arrows down but $bName finds herself unable to climb the tree because that would expose herself to more fire. It’s an impossible battle to win, but $bName has a trick up her sleeve.
[$bName] Motherfucker, DIE!
She times a lucky block with her sword, deflecting one last arrow from near point-blank range. Above her is the bowman, but you can’t see him very well because of the branches and leaves in the tree. Winding back, $bName lowers her sword and brings it upwards with all her might as if she was casting a fishing reel. Incredibly, she lets go of the weapon at the moment it gains the most momentum and it goes flying upwards at incredible speed. With a loud crack the sword hits its target, and some kind of wooden structure falls out of the tree along with a hooded figure. He lands on the ground using both feet and deftly tucks into a roll. Coming up, the strange hooded figure brandishes a long dagger, giving up on his bow that dropped with the rest of the platform. Wild eyed and clearly pissed, $bName draws her own dagger from her waist and the two square off.
You try crawling closer to the conflict in order to do something, anything, but your movement is slow as you drag your body across the dirt. With a grimace, you stand on your good leg and try limping towards the tree. By the time you are up and moving, the battle you were watching just moments ago has already evolved into what can only be described as a fencing match between masters. $bName prances forwards and backwards, stabbing with her dagger while the hooded figure leans back and retreats. Every time the strange figure dodges, he does so with a perfectly calculated amount of effort so that $bName’s attacks miss by mere inches. After $bName has lunged, the figure counters, sending his own well aimed attacks at her neck. $bName skillfully dodges these as well, but with less finesse and a hint of desperation. Blood is pouring out the wound on her arm, and it is likely the arrow that hit her armor cracked a rib or worse. With a grimace she fights on however, better than most could even without injury. Watching the duel rage on, you limp as fast as you can but can’t seem to make enough progress quick enough.
[$pName] STOP!!!
The duel progresses into the grass field, where the tall blades tickle at your waist. Ahead of you by only a few feet the pair continue their deadly dance, and behind them the moon outlines their movements. Finally, a patch of grass below the hooded figure’s foot bends awkwardly causing their ankle to twist, and fall to their knee. Triumphantly, $bName charges forward and stabs her dagger at the mysterious stranger’s hooded face. But as quick as she can lunge, the stranger dodges, and he grabs a hold of $bName’s hand that holds the dagger. With a flash, he moves his other arm upwards and slices $bName’s hand clean off, sending it flying into the air. $bName gasps, and stares at her own appendage flying upward, upward, upward towards the moon. Completely dumbfounded, she glances at you one last time with a look of heart wrenching betrayal before the stranger plunges their dagger straight into her neck and slits her throat. $bName collapses, spilling blood across the grass. 
Slowly, the stranger places their dagger into the crook of their elbow and draws it across, cleaning off the blood that just stained it. With a deliberate motion the stranger turns to face you, and slowly marches forwards. 
The stranger is covered head to toe in midnight black leather and cloth, giving them a rugged and stealthy look. Judging by the height and muscles on the stranger it appears to be a man of a little more than six feet in height. Across the stranger’s chest, waist, legs, arms, and back are countless knives, swords, and weaponry of all kinds. He wears a black hood and Black veil which makes it impossible to see any of his features. As he slowly approaches, you realize he isn’t even breathing hard.
You try to move backwards, but your foot cries out in pain and you stumble to the ground. Wordlessly the stranger approaches, brandishing the dagger until he is right above you. With only one hand he reaches down and grabs you, pulling and twisting until you are forced to your knees. Desperate to stop him, you try to grab at the blade or push him away but it is no use. With a clean swipe he lopes off your outstretched right arm at the elbow, and in the next moment twirls to the other side and takes off the left as well. You are so astonished you feel nothing, and stare dumbly at the stumps where your arms used to be. With a harsh voice that sounds like nails on a chalkboard, he triumphs
[???] I am become DEATH…
The pain from your arms being sliced off finally hits and it burns with such agony you become dizzy. Delirious and exhausted you scream, scream as hard as you can and as long as your lungs allow. The pain is overwhelming, and unlike anything you have ever felt before. Your stumps flail about, sending blood spurting all over the grass. Not a single drop lands on the stranger’s garb as he dodges behind you, and whispers into your ear the last words you ever hear:
[???] …Destroyer of Worlds
The next instant, he sends the dagger into your neck and flicks outwards, completely cutting open your jugular. The last thing you think before bleeding to death is how thankful you are that you don’t have to feel the pain in your arms any longer. Dismembered and defiled, you fall to the ground as a lifeless corpse and gurgle blood across the grass pathetically.
THE END
