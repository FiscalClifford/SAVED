You make your way East, past the plaza and back along the road you came into town on. Despite eating the $food earlier you are already hungry again, and your stomach rumbles fitfully. You take a short break once you reach the brook, and watch as the last glimmerings of sunset peak over the horizon before disappearing entirely. Luckily for you, the moon is bright tonight and you don’t have much trouble navigating along the familiar path. The cool breeze of the summer night gently rustles through the tall grass around you, and the peaceful melody of the night ambience keeps you company as you trod along. Before long you find yourself back at the sign where you first woke up, and you continue past it. Further along the path now you enjoy the slight downhill of a slope and make some easier progress, if you can keep this pace up you will be in Dottle before long. 
Ahead Looms The Oak Tree.
As you climb the hill leading up to the tree, you think It is possible you could rest there for the night, or continue along the path in hope of better shelter. Still deep in thought, you stumble over something and fall down. You try to take another step to break your fall, but your right leg doesn’t respond and you fall heavily into the dirt. Confused, you push yourself up onto your left knee and inspect the right; There is an arrow sticking out of it and is lodged halfway through your thigh just above the kneecap. You stare at it dumbly for a second before the pain hits you like a truck and your leg feels as if it has erupted into fire. Grimacing, you fall over in disbelief and clutch your leg in agony. You scream.
It burns, It burns, it burns, It burns, It burns, it burns 
 Blood starts to seep out of the wound and into your jeans, and despite it seeming like you have been writhing around in pain for hours it has only been 15 seconds. With a sinking feeling, you realize that arrow had to have come from somewhere and you open your bloodshot eyes to scan for your attacker. It is at that moment the second arrow penetrates your skull, and everything goes black.
THE END
