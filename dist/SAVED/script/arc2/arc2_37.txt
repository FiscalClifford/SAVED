You take the path that follows along the outskirts of the forest, and as you trot along butterflies and birds fly above singing their merry songs. Gentle puffs of clouds laze across the sky sending lonely shadows across the open grass fields to your left, and to your right the sound of multitudes of different insects and animals call out in harmony. Continuing along the path, it hugs the edge of the forest and curves to the right, past where you could see before. It doesn’t take long before you can see the path leads to a small cluster of buildings; a large house, a workshop, an outhouse, and a large shed. Each building is made with well cut and aligned timber, but is unpainted and lacking any glass windows. The roofs are made of a ribcage of timber beams and tightly packed dirt, which has turf growing out of it in thick matts of green. Inside the shed is a large amount of cut timber, but you cannot see into the other three buildings.
You approach the cluster of buildings carefully until you notice a small figure hunched over on the front porch of the house. It is a woman, and she is clutching her face while rapidly bouncing her right leg up and down over and over again. Just watching her fret like that is enough to give you anxiety. Finally you get close enough to see her properly, and before you introduce yourself you take note of her appearance. She is a woman of her mid thirties, and is wearing a simple dress made out of a soft beige cloth. Around her neck and tossed behind her is a thin scarf made out of a rough looking material, likely burlap. The wrinkles around her eyes and lines across her forehead make it clear she is stressed out about something. Upon seeing you, she stands up quickly and walks over.
[woman] Oh please mister, have ya seen my husband around lately? He was supposed tah be home hours ago and ah told him not to take the job but he did!
She holds her hands together like she is praying, and pleads at you with genuine emotion in her eyes.
[$pName] well… what does he look like?
[woman] He is about yer height, and is wearing a maroon shirt and a brown vest. He wears a fancy leather toolbelt, he’s tah best carpenter around fer miles! Ya really can’t miss ‘em, he wears tah toolbelt and tah maroon, ah, he is well built and well fed, ah…
[$pName] Where did you last see him?
[woman] well he took a job from a creepy lookin mister this mornin, and he wouldn’t tah takin it if it weren’t fer tah fact tah mister was payin so much and tah job was so easy. Jus’ a simple treehouse ah sorts he said. Ah tol’ him a mister lookin’ like that could only be trouble but he went and did it anyways and hasn’t come back yet! I think they went into tah forest… He shoulda jus’ ignored ‘em and gone tah Dottle…
