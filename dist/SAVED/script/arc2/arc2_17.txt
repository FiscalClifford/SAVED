Wandering around some more, you look desperately for some kind of quiet alleyway or abandoned lean-to shelter to use but even after searching for what feels like forever you simply cannot see anything suitable. Every single alleyway is kept relatively clear of debris and offers little shelter, and every single shack you come across already has so many burlap clad peasants crammed into it there couldn’t possibly be room for you. Eventually you find yourself back at the orb, and despite there being little cover there you resign yourself to sleeping underneath the tree. The leaves will hopefully protect you from rain somewhat if it comes to that, and the orb hides your shameful state from passerby on the road as long as they don’t try very hard to look. Shivering, you fall into an uncomfortable and uneasy sleep.
The next day, you find yourself extremely hungry and in no better a position than the last. You continue to wander the town for the entire day, but never see the women from before again. You don’t find any significant charity either: there isn’t a homeless shelter or any kind of social program to help you at all, and every person you beg for help tells you to simply ‘bug off to the fields’. There is a church towards the North that helps at least; The monk there gives you a single potato each day to eat as well as a burlap sack to wear. Curiously, the burlap sack doesn’t have any logos on it but rather an entire description on how to teach someone to read, as well as a multitude of practice sentences and pictures. It looks like even the poorest here have taught each other to read thanks to these sacks they wear and the result is an impressively literate albeit powerless lower class, which you have now officially joined. The monk doesn’t just give you a potato either, but critical information as well: all the poor people in town work for the church cultivating potatoes in the fields. First you have to save half the potato the monk gives you (which is difficult because you are starving) and plant that anywhere on the North or Western part of town. You keep doing this until you have a decent field going, and can harvest everything in the fall. Then you will have enough potatoes to either double the size of your fields or you can sell them in order to afford materials for a shack. In this way you can slowly grow to feed yourself and escape poverty. With the only other alternative being starvation, you heed his advice and find a cozy field to the North since the west side is already entirely used up. Without any tools you dig with your hands, and under the intense sun it is exhausting work. After a long day of hard work and a constant feeling of wasting away, you take shelter at the tree by the orb and sleep uneasily until the next day. This continues for months, and you can’t help but wonder what strange turn of events led to such a tedious fate. Eventually one day in the middle of the winter, you return to the shack you had built up on the north side of town a month ago with planks of forgotten rotten wood you found laying around. Most of the peasants have large families or gatherings that they use for heat, but after all this time of suffering you are still alone. You curl up on the floor and try to sleep but you are so cold you can’t. The wind is howling outside and it begins to lightly snow. A few more hours of this later and you realize you have to do something soon or you will die. Unfortunately, you are so weak from months of poor eating that you can hardly get up. Crawling, you exit your hut and weakly call for help, but it is too late. A single tear drops out of your eye out of self-pity before you finally succumb to the elements and freeze to death alone in the cold, unforgiving dirt.
THE END
