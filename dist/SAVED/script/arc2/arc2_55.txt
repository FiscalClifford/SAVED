The darkness clouding your mind slowly lifts, and the rushing sound of static overwhelms your senses before suddenly stopping all at once. Your eyes shoot open, and with a start you sit upright, coughing violently. Wildly you whip your head around looking for the mysterious killer, but there is no one in sight. You force yourself to stand, and still shaking run your finger along your throat. It is no longer gushing blood, and it seems your shoulder no longer cries out in pain either. Knees wobbling, you unsteadily rise to your feet and take a deep breath. You still have time, you reflect, time to do things differently.
