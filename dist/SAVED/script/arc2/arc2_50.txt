The Die has been cast.
[$pName] No offense to you two, but I’m going to stick with $bName.
[$aName] WHAT!?!?
$aName slams her hands on the table, immediately standing up and sending $bName’s beer toppling over.
[$aName] BASED ON WHAT!? 
[$liName] $aName! Calm down!
$liName roughly grabs $aName’s dress and pulls her back into her seat. A few patrons around the tavern glance over at the commotion, but once they see there isn’t a fight happening they become disinterested and look away.
[$aName] Ok whatever, but how about you sell us the magic Dragon locator? I’ll pay good money for it…
[$bName] Enough. Without that locator $pName is useless to me, and besides only people from $pLocation would be able to us it to locate the dragon anyways. Respect his decision and leave us.
$aName and $liName begrudgingly leave their seats, and looking back over her shoulder $aName gets her last word in:
[$aName] I should never have offered you a spot in our group $bName, you never would have fit in. And as for you $pName… well good luck dealing with her. You’ll need it.
The two stunning women gather their things, adjust their swords, and storm out of the door. 
[$bName] They aren’t wrong you know. I haven’t travelled with anyone in a long time and I’ve heard  I’m not the easiest travel buddy. I guess my biggest advice for you is don’t say or do anything stupid and we can get along fine.
You gulp.
[$bName] I stopped in Kingsbridge to buy a backup dagger since my old one was falling apart, and before you ask no you cannot have it. I wasn’t intending on staying here for this long however, and want to at least head further east past Dottle where there are less people with prying eyes.
She stands up, gathering herself and preparing to leave. You follow suit, and grab one last piece of cheese off the table to snack on before heading out the front entrance.
[$bName] They raise horses near Dottle and I was hoping to get one this evening, but looks like it will be dark in only a few moments. I’ll get one tomorrow morning and then we will officially begin our journey together.
[$pName] You mean you will be getting two horses right? It would be a little demeaning walking next to you while you ride along…
$bName stares at you blankly, and says nothing. You take the hint, and shut your mouth. The two of you head for the plaza, and carefully make your way across the uneven stones. Turning right you begin heading east, and in the dim light you can barely recognize some of the buildings you had passed by earlier. Eventually the two of you finally exit the town and stroll along the dirt pathway, saying nothing. $bName walks with her head held high and her chest out, and her excellent posture makes her seem like the most confident person in the world.
[$pName] Listen $bName, there is something important I need to tell you.
$bName turns her head to look at you with an expression of surprise.
[$bName] Go ahead.
[$pName] I have an ability of sorts… I guess you could call it a gut feeling… but I can sometimes sorta see the future, in a way. Not exactly, but close enough. And basically, there’s an Oak Tree up ahead past a rickety wooden sign and hiding in that oak tree is an assassin. He is going to attack us.
You look at her face expectantly, waiting to see her reaction. Dropping a bomb like that to someone you barely know isn’t exactly a great way to build a relationship. Despite such grim news however, $bName looks unperturbed and absentmindedly scratches at her mole.
[$bName] Why did you tell me that?
[$pName] … What?
[$bName] You heard me. Why did you tell me that?
[$pName] I’m not sure what you mean. Because I want us to defeat the assassin?
[$bName] Listen. I know you are lying about your background and I know you are lying about your motivations. There is a lot about you that doesn’t add up.  I knew the moment I offered to team up with you there was a good chance you were leading me into a trap, but I couldn’t figure out where or why. And now, you tell me all about the trap? As if you are betraying your assassin friend out of guilt?
[$pName] Assassin friend? It’s not like that at all, I don’t know what you mean…
[$bName] I’m not going to pretend to understand what the hell you are playing at, but if what you say is true then I need to take care of this assassin immediately. I’d much rather face them in open combat than wait for them to kill me in my sleep. I have one rule, and you better follow it.
[$pName] What?
[$bName] Stay at least 20 feet away from me while I take care of this guy, but don’t stray too far either. I don’t trust you, and I don’t want you messing up the fight. Rest assured, I will win. Stay out of my way.
The two of you wordlessly continue along the road, passing over the brook and heading along the path towards the rickety wooden sign where you started what feels like ages ago. The silence is uncomfortable, and the grim resolve with which $bName marches ahead of you is extremely intimidating. Unable to handle the silence anymore and with a while still to go before the moment of truth, you try to coax her into further conversation to break the ice.
[$pName] So… You have been travelling alone for a long time then?
$bName keeps her eye on the path ahead of her, and without turning to look at you replies:
[$bName] It’s a long story, and probably not worth sharing.
[$pName] It isn’t as if we were doing something else more important. I’m all ears.
$bName sighs and looks up at the sky, which is starting to get properly dark now. The first few stars of the night wink down on her, and the moon meagerly begins to light the waving fields of tall grass around the two of you. The sound of the wind caressing the foliage is soothing and familiar.
[$bName] Like I said, I was born in $bLocation. I was an only child, and my mother died giving birth to me so I never knew her. My dad said she looked just like me though and was a gentle spirit.
$bName briefly touches her mole before continuing. At this point she is lost in the memories.
[$bName] My dad was a swordsmith in $bLocation, but not very talented. The job was mostly just so that he could make new swords to practice with, which was his real passion. Ever since I was young he trained me to be a swordswoman, and he insisted that as long as I practiced enough I could beat anyone with a blade. One day when I was about 16 the King requested he join the army in order to make weapons for him, and I never heard or saw him again. Knowing him, he probably got overzealous and tried to join in on a battle. Old fool.
The moonlight glistens off her white cloak as she marches, and reflects brightly as it glances across the bronze rings she wears. The wolf on the back of her cloak winks at you as it waves in the gentle breeze.
[$bName] I stayed in town forging weapons, but hated it the whole time. The only thing I ever really enjoyed was my father’s practice drills, but sword fighting doesn’t make much money in a town without conflict. At about 22 I decided I had enough of waiting for my father to return and traveled south to the border. Mercenary gangs were at their peak back then and one of them, the Wild Wolves…
She juts out her thumb towards her back, pointing at the cloak
[$bName] Took me in eagerly. Their specialty was skirmishing and flanking maneuvers with sword wielding warriors. I fought with them for the next two years, eventually becoming a squad leader and taking part in many battles. I’ve fought on the King’s side, and I fought for $neighborName too. As long as they financed my efforts I didn’t care. Eventually some court official of $neighborName noticed my skill and employed me as a personal bodyguard. So that’s what I did for another couple years until we got caught in an ambush and my employer was killed. People don’t particularly like employing bodyguards that had their VIP killed so I had no choice but to return home with all the savings I had accumulated. When I returned, I was shocked: Half the town was starving. The war had taken its toll even on communities as far away from the frontlines as $bLocation, and the King’s heavy taxation bled it dry of funds. I decided then and there I wouldn’t fight as a mercenary ever again and instead I would find a way to help them.
$bName sighs loudly, and brings her hands together behind her head.
[$bName] Ever since then, which would be around 3 years ago, I have explored around the world looking for the Ancient Dragon and my magical fruit.
You glance at her hands but she doesn’t do the waggle thing.
[$bName] I’m starting to think that neither is real, but seeing the world is nice and I have plenty of money saved up from my old fighting days. It’s better than smithing, that’s for sure.
$bName has probably said more words in the last 10 minutes than she has said in the last 10 months, so you give her a rest and soak in the ambiance of the moonlit countryside. Next, you pass the wooden sign and realize the time has come.
Ahead Looms the Oak Tree.
You tense up with anticipation, but it seems as if $bName isn’t done with her monologue yet.
[$bName] What If I told you that was all a lie? That everything I just told you is a practiced story I have used on countless people so that they would feel like they knew and trusted me? Would you believe me?
She stops walking, and faces you entirely. You freeze, and feel like you can’t move an inch. Not far ahead, the leaves of the oak tree rustle in the wind. $bName’s head perks up slightly, as if she heard or sensed something you couldn’t. 
[$bName] We are going to talk after I take care of this guy, don’t you worry about that.
In a smooth motion $bName draws her blade and looks over her shoulder at you.
[$bName] Stay right there little duckling, it will all be over soon.
Blade drawn, cloak billowing in the wind, $bName marches towards The Oak Tree. Then, every couple of seconds you start to hear a strange sound.
wheeow, ting!
wheeeeeow, clang!
It’s hard to see at first, but $bName is marching towards the Oak Tree and swinging her sword wildly every few seconds. Finally, you realize what the noise is coming from: it is the shrill hiss of an arrow being fired and travelling through the air. Every couple of seconds, someone from the branches of the oak tree is launching an arrow towards $bName, and every time the arrow is launched she swiftly deflects it with her sword. Her silhouette outlined by the moonlight, her hair waving in the breeze, she strikes you as probably the most impressive person you have ever seen. Then, a groaning noise fills the air.
Eeerrrrrrrr… Snap!
The sound of wood groaning and finally breaking rings out like a bell in the night, and you realize the weakened platform can’t handle the strain of the assassin’s weight. With a deafening crash, the platform finally rips free of the tree and falls apart, tumbling and clattering across the branches of the oak tree until finally smashing into the ground below. Along with it goes the hooded assassin, who was caught completely by surprise and smashes into tree branches and eventually the dirt with a loud thud. Quick as a flash he stands back up, but he is clearly wounded and clutches his right arm with his left as if something broke. His left ankle appears smashed to pieces as well, and as he stumbles forward you see that his left foot appears not only almost backwards, but practically sideways as well. 
Despite these traumatic injuries, he looks ready for a fight and deadlier than ever. Letting his right arm hang loosely at his side, he draws a sharp looking shortsword that was sheathed behind his back and points it at $bName. Noticing his injuries and sensing an advantage, $bName doesn’t hesitate for a second and breaks into a sprint. She charges, and leaps at the man, bringing her sword down with all her might.
CLANG!
The sword bounces off the hooded man’s deflection, and continues it’s momentum downwards. Not wanting to let the effort go to waste, $bName follows the momentum and allows it to continue behind her, spinning. Finally she brings it all the way back around and cleaves towards the man’s head, who ducks under in the nick of time. Under her guard now, the man shoves his dagger at $bName’s leg but the blow is deflected by one of the rings that protect her thigh. His attack foiled, $bName presses with an attack of her own and launches the very knee he just tried to slice open at his head and connects solidly, sending him flying backwards. Landing on his back, the hooded man doesn’t even seem phased. He shifts his weight towards his upper body as if he was curling up, then launches with his arms off the ground and lands on his feet as if he were some kind of ninja. Next, he pulls dagger after dagger from the dozens of sheaths hidden across his body and flings them at lightning speed towards $bName. One after another, she parries them to the side while spinning her blade around her in a flourishing dance. At last, the man runs out of daggers and leaps backwards, unarmed.
[$bName] You’re gonna try to run now eh?
[???] rrrrrrrrrrrr…
The man doesn’t run at all but instead starts making a strange guttural sound. It comes from back of his throat and sounds almost like gravel scraping on pavement.
[???] rrrrrrrrrrr AAAACCCHHH!
He follows the gravely sound with an exaggerated noise that sounds like he is loudly clearing his throat. But without warning, the man erupts into inky black smoke in an enormous explosion that pours black clouds out of every pore of his body. The shockwave is so strong it knocks you backwards, and you fall flat on your back. In the corner of your vision you see $bName go flying backwards but she manages to land on her knee, using her sword to stick it into the ground and support herself.
On guard, the two of you try to see through the smoke but it expands rapidly and clouds your entire vision. The man has disappeared, and could attack at any angle.
[$bName] Come here, $pName!
Coughing, you make your way through the thick smoke towards her voice until you practically run into her.
[$bName] Forget what I said earlier, stay close for now.
Her voice is calm, and firm. She glances around warily, waiting for the next attack to come but it never does. After a minute of tension, the smoke finally dissipates and the two of you find yourselves alone on the hill next to the Oak Tree.
With a loud sigh, $bName sheathes her sword and sits down, leaning against the tree. Behind her lay the scattered splinters of the platform, and you feel like a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders.
[$bName] Do you know who that was?
[$pName] Does it matter? He’s finally defeated.
[$bName] Of course it matters, and he isn’t defeated. That was DEATH, and if there is one thing I know its that you can run away from DEATH, and you can stall DEATH, but In the end DEATH always finds you.
[$pName] That’s a little dark…
[$bName] He’s one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, a secret cult of henchmen that work for the Dragon. I wasn’t entirely convinced the Dragon is real, but I didn’t think the horsemen were either until just now. Now I’m… not too sure about any of it.
[$pName] A cult…
[$bName] I don’t remember the full story, but they are probably the most powerful people in the world save for the Dragon himself. They are DEATH, WAR, CONQUEST, and FAMINE. Apparently, they’ve done some pretty fucked up stuff over the years.
$bName closes her eyes, seemingly satisfied with the explanation. You have some more questions to ask but decide to allow her some rest. Ten minutes pass in silence, until she suddenly opens her eyes again and jumps up to her feet.
[$bName] Well, we got to get those horses from Dottle, no time like the present. Lets move.
[$pName] Horses? Plural? Looks like I got a promotion!
[$bName] That’s right, horses for each warrior that saved our skins back there. What? It was only me doing all the work? Looks like it is two horses for me then, and none for you.
You groan loudly, throwing your hands up into the air. $bName chuckles to herself, softly.
[$bName] How about this, let’s make a deal. You keep telling me your ‘gut feelings’ about danger ahead so that I am always ready, and I’ll let you continue along with me. How’s that sound?
[$pName] Sounds good to me!
[$bName] Alright then Duckling, it’s a deal. Don’t waddle too far off now.

And so, the pair of you continued along the path until you made it to Dottle without incident. From then on, the two of you adventured together and $bName even offered to teach you how to defend yourself with a sword. A week passed, and the two of you decide that next up the best way to…
This is going to be the end of this path for now, and this paragraph is a temporary placeholder. I already have the next sections planned out but I likely will not have enough time to finish this before UPT. Bit of a shame because I had some cool stuff coming up, but oh well. For now, Let’s just say you and $bName go on some cool adventures and live happily ever after. The end!

END OF ARC 2, THE TOWN
