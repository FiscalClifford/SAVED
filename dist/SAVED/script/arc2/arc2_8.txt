The shops don’t seem that important so you continue to explore about the town. Exiting the plaza on a road running perpendicular to the one you entered on, you continue to wander absentmindedly. It isn’t long before a new building catches your eye, a wooden church whose steeple jumps out above the surrounding buildings handsomely. Unlike all the buildings you have seen so far, this one Is painted white, and is in great condition. It is not particularly large and looks exactly like a cliché southern church: It is a simple A frame building without any extensions, and at the front where the roof leans to meet at the top of the triangle a small tower juts upwards another several meters. Normally there would be a cross at the top here but instead there is what appears to be a carving of a lizard. Small, beady windows squint at you suspiciously across the front facade and the door stands ajar somewhat invitingly. You decide to head in.
Once inside, your eyes adjust to the shadow of the interior and you begin to pick out your surroundings. In front of you is an aisle, with large wooden benches of fine quality flanking either side all the way to the back of the building. At the back is a simple podium, presumably where the priest would give his sermons. A few candles are lit along the windowsills but give feeble light. Dominating the entire far wall behind the podium is a large wooden carving of magnificent craftsmanship, depicting an incredible scaled Dragon that is so detailed it almost seems lifelike. It contrasts well against an enormous red tapestry that rests behind it and makes it seem as if it is about to roar to life and jump out at you. To the left of the dragon and in the corner of the building is a large pile of burlap sacks, the same as what everyone outside wears. With a loud clang, a door in the far right corner opens up and a man calmly walks towards you without hesitation, interrupting your inspection. He wears simple sandals and a lavishly soft and comfortable looking fluffy robe. The robe is so cuddly in appearance it is almost comical, and it’s dark brown color makes it a little hard to distinguish in the darkness of the church. As he gets nearer, you notice over his heart and stitched into the robe is a small patch of burlap that matches the sacks in the corner. He speaks with a gentle voice as if he were speaking to a young child:
[Robed Man] Hello Stranger, and welcome to the church of the Ancient Dragon. I see that ya do not wear the mark of the humbled, and instead come dressed in strange foreign clothing. Clearly ya have grown ashamed at yer lack of humility and have come for guidance, no?
The robed man comes to a stop in front of you, and smiles warmly. His wrinkled eyes betray no sign of ill will, and his aged face gives the impression of a man in his late fifties.
[$pName] In a way… yes I have come from a far off land. And I seek guidance as well, in a matter of speaking. Please share some knowledge with me father.
The man chuckles softly for a moment, and gives an answer that sounds as if he’s responded the same way hundreds of times before.
[Robed Man] As ya know, this $worldName was created centuries ago by the Ancient Dragon in all his wisdom…
The priest wiggles his fingers across his chest while saying this in a practiced motion
[Robed Man] … In order to provide shelter for his following. His legendary power is so great he could fly about forever, but being all powerful is worthless without an entourage to impress so with a mighty breath of flame he gave birth to our world of $worldName. With his next breath he fired into existence lifeforms such as you and I, and bestowed the most devout and loyal among them magical powers beyond our comprehension. He also created the great Haven, an enormous warehouse filled to the brim with potatoes in burlap sacks. He gave this as a gift to his people and by eating this stock and learning to plant it, they never hungered. As an act of gratitude, his followers adopted the tradition of wearing these burlap potato sacks in some form or another, and so it has continued for hundreds of years. Even today, the church gives out these excess sacks to the poor so that they may be clothed from the weather and devout in their faith.
[$pName] A great warehouse filled with potatoes in modern burlap sacks…
[Robed Man] You will learn in time that while what the Dragon does is strange and mysterious to us, it is all according to his great and wonderous plan. Perhaps one day ya may finally find him and ask him any question ya like, except he’s been missing for about a hundred years. For now however, it would do ya well to show some appreciation for his gift of life and prove your humility.
The man pulls out a strip of burlap that has been tied end to end so as to make a loop, and he drapes it over your wrist so as to make a bracelet.
[Robed Man] Better already. Ya unfortunately are too late for yer charity potato of the day but if ya return at noon tomorrow ya may join in line. While ya may be an outsider and not understand why entirely, please try not to embarrass yerself around town by taking the bracelet off. While I see ya as simply an ignorant foreigner, some may feel yer openly defying the Dragon’s will, or at the very least ungrateful. Anywho its closing time so get the fuck out of my church.
Before you can even respond to his 'unique’ behavior he has already pushed you back out the door the way you came and into the street. With a loud bang the door is shut and locked behind you, ending the possibility of future discussion with the strange monk. Jumbled up by the fall, you decide to head back to the plaza to get your bearings and decide what to do next. You look up at the sky as you walk, and see a decent amount of time has passed and it won’t be long before it’s time to eat dinner. As if it was waiting for you to finally notice, your stomach rumbles in longing. You aren’t sure how you are going to be able to buy food with no money, but luckily you still have the $food from earlier. You pull it out of your pocket just as you arrive back at the plaza, but before you can move to eat it someone catches your eye. It is a beautiful woman with $aHairColor hair, dressed in a vibrantly yellow dress that makes her completely stand out from the crowd. She is followed by a similarly dressed friend except she is in lavender instead of yellow, and the two make for an extremely odd pair. Your short glimpse of her is enough to make an immediate impression, despite her disappearing in and out of the crowd, and she passes by you towards the church at a quick pace. Despite the tiny amount of time you were able to see her, you understand she must be someone very important.
