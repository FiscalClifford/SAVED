The darkness clouding your mind slowly lifts, and the rushing sound of static overwhelms your senses before suddenly stopping all at once. Your eyes shoot open, and with a start you sit upright. After an entire lifetime you had eventually gotten used to your aging body, but now everything is different. Where before there were wrinkles there is now taut skin, where you once had aching joints there is pain free muscle. In disbelief, you slowly rise to your feet and try to get used to your new, youthful body. The feeling of being reborn is revitalizing but at the same time… you lived your life. You finally found peace with your path in this world, and now it has been… robbed from you. And now the memories come flooding back, the memories of how everything changed when you were inexplicably teleported here all those years ago but ran away from the answers. As these memories you hid away for so long overwhelm you, with a sinking feeling it occurs to you that there is truly no escape. No matter how long you run, fate will always catch up to you. Knees wobbling, you unsteadily rise to your feet and try to get a hold of yourself. You still have time, you reflect, more time than you ever imagined possible to do things differently.
