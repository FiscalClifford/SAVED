[$pName] I need you to explain everything that’s happened so far. This might be our last chance to escape and we can’t waste it.
[$bName] It’s really important you help us.
[$thiefName] I can see you’re pretty determined… just like the old $pName and $bName, eh? Alright…
$thiefName stands up and walks up to the bars so that you can communicate better. His expression is one of true care towards a friend.
[$thiefName] Well we met about six months ago and I thought you guys were pretty cool so I asked to join up, which nobody had a problem with. I reckon since I’m the newest member of the team that makes me a little suspicious looking, but I’m really not the traitor! Anyways we became pretty good friends $pName, and I’m sure we will be able to get that started up again just fine once we bust outta here… uh, where was I? Oh, we went on some great adventures until about four months ago when FAMINE got us. He had us at the wrong time at the wrong place and there was nothing we could do, it for sure was a setup and it had to be because of a traitor being among us. We were all imprisoned and he ate your memories and something called a “savefile” whatever that means. He would spend weeks at the castle lazing around, and would eat your memories for dinner every night. The shock of having your psyche eaten would knock you out until morning and then you would wake up thinking you had just left Kingsbridge. You would beg me for hours wanting to know what was going on, and I would tell you what I’m saying now over and over. It really was heartbreaking, all the more because you treated me like a stranger… Anyways you managed to bust out something like two months ago and left with somebody, but I couldn’t see who. FAMINE drug you back over here after catching you and ate your memories on the spot…
$thiefName shivers and winces.
[$thiefName] It’s a good thing you can’t remember the sounds FAMINE makes as he consumes you, it is truly terrible…
$bName places a reassuring hand on your back and looks at you sympathetically.
[$pName] I’m ok. Keep going $thiefName.
[$thiefName] Well it took a long time for you to muster up another attempt, and I was just about to go crazy from all the begging you had been doing asking me to explain what was going on for the trillionth time. ‘Bout four days ago you busted out again because I couldn’t take it anymore and picked our locks with my only set of secret lockpicks, then we got everyone else freed and went around the castle looking for clues. For some reason you were adamant that we shouldn’t take $bName with us, which I didn’t agree with, but since you used to be our perfect gang leader I didn’t question you about it too much…
$bName looks saddened by the mention of how she was left behind, clearly revisiting the painful memory.
[$thiefName] You went to the library upstairs first because there was some kind of important clue there, and talked to Powell about it for a little bit. Then we all joined up and went to this office down a hallway because you said all the evidence you would need to figure out who the traitor is would be kept inside. You asked me to pick the lock of course, and I did, but once we got inside the lights all went out and I heard $medicName scream. Everyone panicked and next thing you know the stone Golem is all over us. $toughName starts fighting the Golem and was winning, but Powell got hurt in the confusion so we all had to retreat with the Golem hot on our heels. Well as we were running Powell kept pointing ahead of us at you and $medicName for some reason, but he was too weak to say much and was bleedin’ all over the place. We escaped back to the jail and kept the Golem on the other side of the door long enough for him to go away. We all went into our cells after that, and I knew we weren’t going anywhere with Powell as hurt as he was. My lockpicks had broken busting you out but I stuck one of the fragments into the latch on your cell door just in case you could try and escape again. Lo and behold, FAMINE hears about our escape attempt and is furious, so he beat you me and $toughName up real bad and wiped your memories yet again. I wonder why he only ever ate yours… Anyways as a safety measure he tied you to the cell as well, but what he wasn’t expecting was that you would rub that rope against the metal nonstop for the next several days like a wild animal. I heard him consume your memory one final time last night before leaving the castle, but luckily he never noticed the fraying rope. And… uh… I guess that’s basically all I know. You’re all caught up.
[$bName] Hmmm…
