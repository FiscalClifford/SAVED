The four of you make your way through the great hall and exit through the enormous front door made entirely of Oak. The weather is pleasant and a cool breeze immediately refreshes you. There is a path leading from the castle that meanders through the surrounding woods, and you start down it hoping to get as far away as you can, as quickly as you can. You and your friends take maybe ten steps towards freedom before you hear the loud shattering of glass behind you, and you spin to see what caused it.
Out of a window on the second floor comes a massive Stone Golem, which careens through the air and smashes into the ground below causing a slight tremor that makes you stumble. Without missing a beat the incredible Golem rises to its feet and marches towards you. The Golem is perhaps 8 feet tall and made almost completely of stone, and looks extremely tough. $toughName cracks his knuckles and stands in front of everyone, readying himself.
[$toughName] Ah’ve been waitin’ fer a rematch a looooong time, have at ye!
The golem charges and grabs $toughName’s shoulders, who does the same. The two lock together and push with all their strength, trying to get the other off balance so that they can gain an advantage. $toughName’s huge muscles bulge mightily through his rags and a bead of sweat forms on his forehead.
[$pName] C’mon $toughName!
Suddenly, $toughName drops to his knees. You are afraid the Golem had brute forced him down, but actually $toughName had grabbed the Golem’s arm and wanted to use his body as leverage to flip the Golem over. With a mighty pull $toughName yanks on the Golem’s arm while spinning and putting his back towards his foe, so that the Golem is caught off balance and is flipped over $toughName. With a massive thud the Golem lands on it’s back in the dirt, and $toughName scrambles to throw his legs over the Golem’s chest. He now has it in an armbar, and strains with all his might to dislocate the Golems arm. Unlike humans however, the golem is made of stone so fissures and cracks develop and form all across the Golems torso and arm like a spiderweb. The two strain against each other, then…
CRACK
The Golems arm is entirely broken off, and chunks of stone fly in all directions. With a pained roar the Golem tries to throw a punch at $toughName, but he has already retreated and avoids the blow. Once again the two square off against eachother, and it looks like the fight is still dead even. The golem has one less arm, but barely even seems to care. $toughName on the other hand is completely out of breath and sweats profusely.
[$pName] C’mon…
The Golem charges yet again. This time he changes targets and goes straight for you however, and in a panic you fall backwards. The Golem looms closer and closer, and you scramble backwards trying to create distance. Just when it looks like the Golem is about to smash you underneath it’s foot, $toughName appears out of nowhere and dives at the Golem’s back, knocking it over. By the time the two stop rolling on the ground you can see that $toughName has the Golem in a headlock, and uses all his remaining energy to strain against the Golems neck. It roars in anger and tries to knock $toughName off, but his grip and will to win is too strong. Fissures form across the Golems upper torso, and before you know it $toughName manages to wrench the Golems head straight off its body. The moment the head is disconnected the entire body disintegrates into a thousand shards of stone, and the fight is over. You breathe a sigh of relief; $toughName has won.
[$pName] You did it!
[$thiefName] Thank goodness! Nice one!
[$toughName] Wha’ ah fight! Ah’m gonna feel tha’ one inna mornin…
The four of you triumphantly high five and for the first time in half a year walk along the path as free individuals. You have escaped!
