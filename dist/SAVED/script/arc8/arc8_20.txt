You enter the library, and take a look around. The floor is solid hardwood, and the walls are covered with purple drapes that gentle sweep along the walls of the room. There is a single large window that lets in some pleasant sunlight, and through it you can gaze across the verdant forest surrounding the castle. The walls are lined with bookshelves which in turn hold hundreds of unique looking titles. The smell of the library is calming and has exactly the same pleasant aroma you get when opening an old book.
