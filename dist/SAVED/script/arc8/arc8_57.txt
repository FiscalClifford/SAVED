[THE ANCIENT DRAGON] WAR has tread into dangerous territory, questioning reality is seen as a crime by some. Long ago, I questioned my reality and paid the ultimate price. The last thing I want is for you to share the same fate… $pName, it is time. I have existed for billions of years, trapped in this existence as an immortal being of perpetual suffering. If you have any empathy at all for the only other real person in this world, you will end my life. I don’t want to be a god anymore; I want to rest. Existence is pain for me. I beg you, $realName, kill me. Kill me, and send this universe into oblivion.
[$pName] But what about the wish?
[THE ANCIENT DRAGON] There never was a wish, $pName. Only a carrot on a stick meant to get you to this part right here, where you finally fulfill your duty.
