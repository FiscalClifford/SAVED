You move past until finally there is only one last jail cell on your left, the fifth cell. Sleeping close to the bars is none other than $bName, who is just as intimidating and beautiful as the day you first met her in Kingsbridge.

She twitches in her sleep fretfully, but doesnâ€™t notice you standing outside her cell.
