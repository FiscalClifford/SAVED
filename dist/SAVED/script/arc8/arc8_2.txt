You wake up shivering, barely protected by the tattered rags you wear on your body. Your shoulders ache in pain, and your hands are tied behind you to a metal wall of bars by a frayed rope. You blink, and try to get your bearings. You are inside a dark, dingy jail cell with thick stone walls on three sides and a wall of metal bars with a locked metal door on the fourth. You are tied to one of the metal bars and facing towards the center, which is empty. The floor is stone and very cold. You are wearing a dirty shirt made of burlap which rubs uncomfortably against your skin, and your feet are bare. Your tattered pants are covered in dried blood, but you don’t sense any wounds on you that may have created it. Your left forearm is extremely itchy but since it is behind your back you can’t look to see why. Looking down at your chest and legs, you notice a surprising number of battle scars that you don’t remember ever being there before.
What the hell is going on?
[$pName] Hello…?
Nobody responds. There are no windows and it is very hard to see. You struggle against the rope tying you to the bars and notice there are only a few strands left of it holding it together. Concentrating, you rub the rope up and down behind you against the metal hoping to wear it down some more. It takes about twenty minutes of total effort, but in the end you finally manage to do it and the rope snaps.
You awkwardly stand up with your hands still tied behind you. While the rope connecting you to the metal was weak the thick knots forcing your hands together is not, and you feel defenseless without the use of your hands. You face the bars and try to look as far out of your cell as you can. Your cell is connected to a hallway which has no cells on the opposite side of you, and ends abruptly on your right. To your left it extends a ways down, further than you can see from your perspective. There are likely more cells to your left but you cannot see them because of the stone wall in the way.
[$pName] Is anybody there?
Nobody responds. You hear a faint shuffle somewhere to the left and you hope the sound isn’t coming from whoever put you in here. You furtively explore your cell but find nothing other than a bucket in the corner overflowing with refuse. With nothing else left to do, you approach the metal door and hope for the best, pushing on it. Unbelievably it swings open with little force and you are filled with momentary relief. The metal hinges creak loudly as you slowly urge it open, and you hear the faint ringing of a small piece of metal which had fallen out of the locking mechanism and onto the ground. It appears someone must have sneakily put this metal fragment inside the mechanism at some point, inhibiting the lock and allowing you to escape. Out of your cell now, you peer down the hallway. At the end of the passage is a thick looking wooden door and a small amount of light seeps out from under it. Along the left side of the hallway are five jail cells other than your own.
The first cell on your left holds a lonely looking man who is hugging his knees to his chest in the far corner of the cell. It is too dark to see well, but he looks like he has a lanky build and a long nose, with hair tucked into a ponytail behind his head. He is dressed in poor clothing similar to yours.
