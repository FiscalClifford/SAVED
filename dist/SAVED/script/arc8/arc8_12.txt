[$bName] FAMINE consumed your memories so that you can’t remember your goals and who your friends are. He knows what you are capable of and probably thought by robbing you of your memories you wouldn’t have the determination to beat him. Prove him wrong $pName! 
$bName adopts a determined pose.
[$bName] Explore the Castle for clues, find the Jail Cell Keys, question everybody, and figure out who the traitor is! Then free the rest of us so that we can make a daring escape. Avoid Famine, and watch out for an evil Golem patrolling the Castle. We’ve done a daring escape before; we can do it again!
[$pName] Alright!
You share her pose for a moment, and the two of you smile. 
[$bName] I’m going to try to sleep a little more… Be careful out there $pName. And good luck!
