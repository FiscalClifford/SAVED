You are inside a gathering hall, likely the largest space in the castle. There are a few couches and animal pelt rugs laying around, as well as a massive fireplace in the corner. The stone walls tower upwards about three stories high before arching together in an impressive display of architecture. You can see a magnificent Oak door that likely leads outside, a staircase leading to a second floor balcony that overlooks the main hall, a passageway that leads further into the castle, and a heavy looking door that leads to the jail cells. The thudding of heavy footsteps from somewhere in the castle echo off the walls ominously, and you get the feeling you are being watched.
