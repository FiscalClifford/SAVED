You head down the passageway, and the sound of footsteps seem to get louder. The hair on the back of your neck stands up. The passageway has a few paintings on the walls, which depict biblical figures suffering as they are eaten alive by a group of cannibals. Needless to say, you do your best to tread quietly. One end of the corridor leads to a series of uninteresting rooms and a kitchen, but most notably an office or study of some kind where FAMINE likely spends much of his time. It is firmly locked. On the other end of the corridor is the way leading to the main gathering hall.
