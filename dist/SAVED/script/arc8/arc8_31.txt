You shove the jail key into the lock on her cell door and twist. With a heavy mechanical thunk the latch is undone allowing $toughName to be free. Without hesitation $toughName throws the door open and barges forwards towards you, gripping your neck with both hands lifting you up and into the air.
[$pName] Urk… Wait…
[$toughName] THIS IS FER POWELL! DIE TRAITOR!
$toughName tightens his grip on your throat and crushes your neck, resulting in a loud snap as your spine is fractured. Your limbs go limp and you can’t feel anything below your neck anymore. Before you can even think about your total paralysis the oxygen deprivation overwhelms you and the world starts to go black. The anger and look of betrayal in $toughName’s eyes as he squeezes the life out of you haunts your memory until the very last second, then you succumb to your injuries and die.
THE END
