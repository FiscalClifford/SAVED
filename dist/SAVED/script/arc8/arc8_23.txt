[$pName] Tell me everything you know about what’s happened so far.
[$medicName] You don’t trust me? Fine... About a year ago we met near a town called Durango, and worked together to defeat a bunch of Cultists who had been terrorizing the locals. $toughName and I had been travelling together for a while back then and decided to join you, $bName, and Powell after our little adventure. We went on some amazing escapades after that and eventually met $thiefName about six months ago. Four months ago we were captured by FAMINE, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Somehow or another he knew exactly where we were going and exactly how to capture us, which made me suspect someone in our group had ratted us out to him. Anyways, he consumed your memories and trapped us all in his castle and we have been stuck here ever since.
[$pName] Hmmm…
[$medicName] Since we have been trapped here you have tried to escape twice. The first time you escaped you freed… $bName. I saw the two of you passing my cell to leave, I guess the hinge on her door was rusty and you were able to break it open. The two of you promised to escape and come back with the jail cell keys, but instead you were caught by FAMINE and dragged back into your cells. Before your memory was wiped again however, you managed to cut into your arm a warning for your future self.
You look down at your left forearm, and read the words scarred across your flesh: $bName is the Traitor.
[$medicName] The warning worked, because four days ago or so you tried to escape again. This time you were smart and freed everyone except for $bName, and we all escaped into the castle together. I wanted to just leave but you insisted on looking around for clues as to who the traitor was… I guess you still didn’t want to believe $bName was the traitor. In the end your gallantry backfired because we got attacked. We were near the kitchen, which is down the main hallway, when the lights went out and the stone Golem ambushed us. I screamed, and in the dark the Golem inflicted a grievous wound on Powell. $toughName looked like he might have beaten the Golem but we had to retreat and try to save Powell so he picked Powell up and we all ran for the jail so that we could block the door behind us. We were running together and $toughName, $thiefName, and Powell were behind us. Once we got back to the safety of the cells you kept looking at me funny so I went back into my cell while you hung out in Powell’s cell with him for a little and then $thiefName’s. FAMINE barged in to interrupt everyone and locked you back up then wiped your memory again. He’s been wiping your memory almost every night actually. Anyways that is all I know. Would you let me out now please?
