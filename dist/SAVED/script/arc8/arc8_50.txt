[$pName] $medicName is the traitor!
$toughName’s eyebrows raise up in surprise, but he doesn’t interrupt you.
[$pName] My evidence is as follows. First, when questioning her about my first escape attempt she said that I left with $bName, and she knew this because she saw us passing by her cell. Because of the positioning of the cells, if I left with $bName then she wouldn’t have been able to see us leave together since $bName’s cell is closer to the exit than $medicName’s. So either she lied about me leaving with $bName, or according to $bName’s story I left with $medicName and she must have gotten us caught on purpose. That’s evidence number one.
$toughName stares at you.
[$pName] Evidence number two is her screaming. Have you ever noticed every time she screams in fear, the golem appears from a portal like how it did during our second escape attempt? But then when she isn’t around then the golem never teleports? That’s because she isn’t screaming, but rather using a control word. She has the power to teleport the golem in front of us in order to slow our progress down, and she activates her magic by making that screaming sound. She used that control word before we could get into the office because she didn’t want us to see FAMINE’s private files. That’s three.
$toughName crosses his arms, but he looks less angry at you.
[$pName] The third piece of evidence, and likely the most important, comes from our second escape attempt as well. During the confusion of the Golem attack near the office, Powell was mortally wounded and bled from his neck. But if the Golem was assaulting us, and it only uses blunt force attacks, then how was he cut on the neck? It had to be $medicName, who used her scalpel to take Powell out while we were distracted and blamed the injury on the Golem. She did this because Powell was starting to figure out she was the traitor and so she felt forced to silence him as soon as possible. Through testimonies of the event, it has even been said that Powell pointed at me and $medicName with his last bit of energy as we retreated. You misunderstood, $toughName, and thought he was pointing at me; in reality he was pointing at $medicName, his killer.
$toughName looks shocked, and you can see the puzzle pieces starting to come together in his mind.
