[Maud] Incorrect. Liar.
Maud reveals her right hand, and you can see that there aren't any fingers there at all. The only thing visible on that disfigured stump of a hand is her gruesome injury. Maud points a finger at you from the other hand, and begins chanting a long phrase of strange sounds and guttural utterances that makes no sense. The air begins to fill with energy, and you notice her hair start to slowly raise up as it is caught in a swirling electrical current around her. Finally, she shouts something and a huge white flash erupts from her finger, obscuring your vision and blinding you. Instantly, you are completely engulfed in the tremendous power of a bolt of lightning and your flesh is vaporized straight off your bones, leaving only your charred skeleton behind. Your remains clatter across the throne room floor, echoing off the walls. You are dead.
THE END
