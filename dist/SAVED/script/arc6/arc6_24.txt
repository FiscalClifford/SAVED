Your eyes open. Somehow, against all odds, you are still not dead. In your soul you can feel you are very close however, and only have perhaps a few more moments of lucidity before everything fades away for the last time. You turn your head slowly to the side, towards where you hear a faint shuffling sound. You can’t believe your eyes. It is $mName, dragging his dying body slowly towards you at a snails pace.
[$pName] … $mName?
$mName feebly crawls towards you, inch by inch, leaving a trail of blood behind him. He struggles tremendously against his own frailty, and after ages of effort finally manages to pull himself up alongside you and rests his head against your leg.
[$mName] I’m sorry… I couldn’t help you more, $pName…
His voice is faint, and pained with emotion. He looks like he really believes it is his fault everything happened.
[$pName] It’s not… your fault…
[$mName] Take… this…
$mName reaches into his coat, and pulls out a scrap of paper and hands it to you. It is faded and wrinkled as if it has been folded and unfolded a million times.
[$mName] My most… valued treasure… a gift… from my mentor…
You turn it, and look at what it says. It reads:
Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A
[$mName] I never learned… what it meant… I want to know… before I die. $pName, do you know?
You fold the paper back up again, and place it back in $mName’s hands serenely.
[$pName] Some kind of… inside joke… from another world… I guess. *cough* Insulting… at a time like this…
[$mName] Oh… I see…
$mName sighs, and relaxes. He closes his eyes as if he were taking a nap, and stops moving. This time, he falls asleep for good. $mName is dead. Silently, you wish that the code was able to make a difference, wish that this was all a game. You wish everything was smiles and roses, and that the good guy wins in the end. Right now however, you are feeling pretty discouraged. This doesn’t feel like a happy video game adventure at all. This feels like hell.
You shudder, and take your last breath. You are dead.
THE END
