[$pName] I’m sorry…. I’m sorry $aName, I’m so sorry…
You pull out your old knife you have attached to your belt, the same one $aName kindly bought for you so long ago back when you had first arrived at the barony. You slowly bring it closer to $aName’s sleeping form. Can you really do this?
[Maud] Get on with it!
A single tear of regret slides down your face inadvertently as you begin to cut off $aName’s fingers, one by one. It makes a disgusting squelching sound as you rip and tear, and blood spews from $aName all the while. It is a gruesome sight, and Maud watches all the while in delight. Finally, after what feels like ages, you finish.
[Maud] I can’t believe it! You actually did it!
You turn your back on $aName so that you don’t have to look at the result of your nefarious deed. You are too ashamed of yourself.
[$pName] I… I did it. Now help me defeat the bandits.
[Maud] HA! HAHAHA! You are truly the most despicable person I have ever met in my entire life! Atrocious! Without morality! Completely devoid of it!
Maud laughs at you like children laugh at animals meandering around in a zoo. 
[Maud] Are you even human? What kind of person betrays their friend like that? I am certainly cruel for suggesting it, I get that, but you must be either the most heartless person in the world or the most desperate, I’m not sure which.
Maud lithely drops down from her throne, and slowly walks up to you. She doesn’t even glance at $aName, who still sleeps on the floor ignorant of her gruesome injuries.
[Maud] Let me make something very clear. You are the most perverted, worthless, abhorrent and gutless human being I have ever met. You can’t negotiate, you can’t protect your friends, and worst of all you betray them as if it is nothing.
[$pName] Like it’s nothing!? I have lost everything! I have lost everything again and again, I’m running out of options! You have no idea how hard that decision was to make!
[Maud] Don’t blame your failures on me, boy. You disgust me. I will never help you, for as long as I live. Strellooooo!!!
The world goes black. You dream.
You dream you are on the beach, riding the waves with your bare feet perfectly balanced on the water. You are laughing, and having the time of your life. You enjoy yourself greatly for a few minutes, and finally ride a wave back to shore where you can feel the luscious warmth of the sand as it snuggles between your toes. You turn around to face the ocean, and wave to your friends who are riding the waves just like you were a second ago. Behind them, the clouds turn dark grey and lightning strikes rapidly as the wind begins to pick up. A massive storm is coming, and your friends have no idea what is coming. You shout, yell, and wave as much as you can but you can’t make any noise. The storm gets closer and closer, and a huge hurricane forms and gets ready to sweep everyone you care about away. You try as hard as you can to get their attention but it is no use, they can’t hear or understand you. You are alone. You weep as the hurricane overwhelms them and sweeps them away into the abyss. Deep down you know it is your fault. You are nothing.
You wake up with tears streaming down your cheeks, alone and in the forest. The fog is thick, and a thin layer of dew covers your body. Maud must have dumped you out here after casting her spell on you. You try gain your bearings, and notice that In front of you is $aName’s lifeless body. An arrow protrudes from her neck, and in her dying moments she must have desperately pawed at it with her fingerless stub fruitlessly before bleeding out. Standing above her is a bandit. He has Fiery red hair, and a black eye patch covering his left eye. He is taller than you by half a foot and bulging with muscles. Despite the cold he only wears pants which leaves his muscular chest exposed, and you notice it is covered in scars. Slung diagonally across his back are two swords in parallel, one is plain steel and the other is sheathed in an incredible onyx scabbard covered in ornate golden decorations.
[???] Nice to meet you again, $pName. My name is Axel, the greatest bandit chieftain to have ever lived. I am here to kill you yet again. Now without further ado…
Axel moves forward with a rapid movement and hits you in the side of the head. Everything goes black.
By the time you wake up, you realize you are hogtied face down in the mud, with your arms and feet bound together. You can’t move your hands or legs at all, and your head aches miserably where Axel hit you. A cold chill runs across your body and you realize you are naked.
[Axel] Look who is back! Time to begin.
Axel is holding a small, wickedly sharp dagger in his hand and is standing directly over you. He has a look of remorse in his eyes.
[Axel] I really am sorry about this.
Axel bends over and grabs your head, yanking it to the side. You struggle to escape and fight back but it is no use, you can’t move at all. Axel grabs your ear and presses the dagger against the base of it, then saws at it savagely up and down several times until it is severed from your head. It hurts terribly, and sends waves of excruciating pain throughout your entire body. You scream.
[Axel] I know, I know, it hurts. Just doing my job man…
Axel cuts off the other ear as well, then moves to your right side. Your eyes water in pain and you wail pitifully into the empty forest for help but there is no one there to hear you. Next, Axel grabs one of your hands, which you desperately try to free from the bindings to no avail.
[Axel] This one’s a doozy…
He stabs the dagger underneath your fingernail, sending searing pain into your hand that is so acute you can’t believe it is real. He digs and digs with it, sending wave after wave of excruciating pain across your body. Finally, after what certainly must have been an entire week of digging, he turns the dagger and twists it to remove the fingernail entirely. The red hot sensation of the nail being cut out is unbearable, but you admittedly feel a sense of relief that since the nail is gone it will finally be over.
[Axel] It never feels good to have bits of your body taken off. Especially the important bits
Axel taps his black eyepatch.
[Axel] I was real sad when I lost my eye, that is one of the most important bits on your body. Not as important as your willy of course, but a close second. 
Axel looks off in the distance lost in thought for a moment before finally coming back to reality and gripping your hand again.
[Axel] What’s up with your friend there anyways? That girl woke up absolutely freaking out, gripping her hand and screaming like no tomorrow. When we finally arrived to see who was hollering so much, we couldn’t believe how easy you made it for us to kill you! That crazy girl sure was mad at you, but for some reason she just wouldn’t buzz off and tried to protect you anyways. Real touching. We had to kill her of course, but you should have seen the way she fumbled her sword around without any fingers! I almost felt bad for her. Crazy coincidence, my ex wife… Eh, never mind. Speaking of fingers, time to get the nails off of all your other fingers too.
What follows is a blurry haze of unbelievable pain that rips at your body over and over again. You are completely helpless to stop it, and every time the pain becomes so overwhelming that you lose consciousness you wake up only a few minutes later to find that Axel has waited for you to come to before continuing once again. One after the other he painstakingly removes every single fingernail and toenail on your body, and by the end of it you have completely lost your mind. As he rips off the last toenail you scream and laugh manically, shuddering violently against your bindings. The receptor in your brain that recognizes pain has at this point been completely shot, and you are numb to all feeling in your body.
[Axel] Well my friend, that’s all I can stomach to be honest. Until next time.
Axel flips the dagger in his hand to point downwards, and he plunges it into your chest. You hear the thud of it slicing into your organs but feel nothing. 
[Axel] Goodbye.
Axel gets up and casually strolls into the forest until he is engulfed in fog. tied up and dying, you watch him solemnly as he disappears. You whisper pitifully into the mud.
[$pName] I’m sorry, $aName. I’m so sorry.
A tear runs down your face as you succumb to your injuries and die. It’s over.
THE END
