As you get closer to the exit you notice with some dissatisfaction the self checkout section is closed and you will have to make small talk with the cashier. There is no one else in the entire store so you walk right up and hand your selection over. The cashier discards her bored expression for a new one of mild amusement and scans. According to her nametag her name is Debbie, a 30 something year old woman that looks like she enjoys jigsaw puzzles and smells like she enjoys cigarettes even more. You realize “looks like she enjoys jigsaw puzzles” isn’t exactly a vivid description but its accurate all the same.
Eager to get the process moving along so that you can enjoy your treat, you move to insert your debit card into the card reader. As the machine begins to authorize the transaction, you realize Debbie is probably going to force some small talk on you soon. Time to prepare; the weather sure is nice today… the local sports team is doing a great job… nice to meet you my name is…? What is your name again?
