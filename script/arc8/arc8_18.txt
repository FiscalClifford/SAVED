You are upstairs on the balcony that overlooks the main hall. The view is impressive, and the balcony is decorated with numerous tapestries and woven designs. Against the wall is a wooden peg board that holds a multitude of keys, which likely open up all kinds of different areas to the castle. Further along the balcony is a door that leads to a room on the second floor further into the castle, and it looks like some kind of library.
