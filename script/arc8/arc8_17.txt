You push the huge Oak door open and step outside. The weather is pleasant and a cool breeze immediately refreshes you. There is a path leading from the castle that meanders through the surrounding woods, and you start down it hoping to get as far away as you can, as quickly as you can. You take maybe ten steps towards freedom before you hear the loud shattering of glass behind you, and you spin to see what caused it.
Out of a window on the second floor comes a massive Stone Golem, which careens through the air and smashes into the ground below causing a slight tremor that makes you stumble. Without missing a beat the incredible Golem rises to its feet and marches towards you. The Golem is perhaps 8 feet tall and made almost completely of stone, and it looks extremely tough. Before you can even think about whether you should fight it or try to run away, it is already upon you and grips you tightly.
[$pName] UGH! Let go!
The Golem picks you up easily, like a child picks up a toy, and raises you into the air gripping each of your wrists. Slowly, steadily, it spreads its hands apart until you are suspended in the air with each of your arms stretched out as if you are on a cross. The Golem has a larger wingspan than you, and before you know it your arms dislocate out of their shoulder sockets with a loud POP.
[$pName] AAAGHHHH
The Golem doesn’t stop. It continues to pull at your arms, ripping and tearing at them as if tearing a drumstick off a chicken. It takes mere seconds before your appendages can’t handle the stress anymore and both of your arms are ripped completely off your body, sending a spray of blood in both directions. You fall down to the ground armless, screaming.
[$pName] AAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
The pain is monumental and the blood loss is unstoppable. You will bleed out in mere minutes, if not for the Golems next action. Without even acknowledging your suffering, the Golem solemnly raises a stony foot and smashes it down at your head, popping it like a watermelon. Your brains and nervous tissue explode from your skull violently and spill out across the ground. Without the aid of someone strong like $toughName, you don’t stand a chance against the Golem. You are dead.
THE END
