[$pName] Maybe I could figure out who the traitor is if you remind me everything that has happened so far? Perhaps by remembering we can discover some kind of hint…?
[$bName] Hmm… It’s worth a shot.
$bName begins to pace the room, and her hand attaches to her hip similar to how she used to rest it on the pommel of her sword a long time ago. Looks like some habits never die.
[$bName] I’ll tell you everything I know then, the quick version. After leaving Kingsbridge we travelled around the kingdom looking for my magical fruit… ah right, that fruit… stupid. Anyways, we travelled looking for it and one day a bandit almost killed you so I taught you how to use a sword. We spent most of our days travelling, doing odd jobs, and training. You were pretty annoying but respectful for the most part and I guess I started to ease up on you after a while. Oh god, I just realized you probably forgot how to swordfight too… what a waste. Anyways…
$bName leans against one of the stone walls of her cell, engrossed in the memories.
[$bName] After maybe half a year we met Powell, an old mercenary friend I knew from years ago. He is one of the greatest duelists I have ever met, and is held two cells down I believe. We went to…
[$pName] You mean the dead guy? I saw a dead guy lying in a pool of blood two cells down. That must be Powell… Ah, I’m sorry, that was a little too blunt…
$bName winces upon hearing the death of her friend, but continues bravely.
[$bName] Dead huh? Shit… Must have happened during your second escape. I’ll get to that in a second…
She adjusts her posture and runs a finger along the metal of the cell bars.
[$bName] You, me, and Powell all went to this crappy little town Durango at one point to fight some cultists, and there we met $toughName who is a big burly fighter and $medicName who is our combat medic. She’s in the cell right next to mine, I think. We all went on some crazy adventures together and created a name for ourselves as a force to be reckoned with. I remember…
$bName’s eyes start to glisten with emotion again.
[$bName] That was around the time I began to really notice you. I noticed how much you had grown, how confident you had become. You became this impossibly perfect leader, and no matter how difficult the situation became you always figured out how to get out of it. It was like you could see the future or something, it was incredible. And that’s about when I fell in love with you…
She looks down and hangs her head, getting a hold of herself. She takes a deep breath and looks back at you and resumes her story.
[$bName] You were the first person I could completely trust in a long time. We were inseparable, and our merry gang tore up the Kingdom fighting villains, discovering treasure, and exploring forsaken lands… It was beautiful.
$bName wipes a single tear off her cheek and glances up at you, smiling. The way you blankly look back at her reminds her you don’t share these golden memories anymore and her smile quickly fades.
[$bName] Pretty recently, maybe only half a year ago $thiefName joined us as well. He is a lanky guy with a long nose and a ponytail. He is really good at lockpicking and even better at dancing… Anyways you two got along really well and quickly became best friends. Let’s see… after that… after that was around four months ago, when we got caught by Famine’s trap and eventually imprisoned here. Believe it or not this is the first time since we were captured I have been able to properly speak with you, isn’t that sad? I thought this whole time you were going to figure out another perfect solution to getting out of this, just like usual, but what I didn’t know was that you had your memory wiped and barely even remembered me…
You grimace but say nothing.
[$bName] Unfortunately, there isn’t much more to say about the outside world after that because I have been stuck in my cell this entire time. About two months ago you tried to escape, and I think you managed to free $medicName as well because her cell door latch was rusty and you somehow broke it and got her out. The two of you went off to get the jail cell keys and free everybody. I called out to you but when you came over to talk $medicName kind of stood between us. You argued with her for a bit but she convinced you to leave without talking to me. In the end you returned maybe an hour later pretty beat up, and FAMINE was carrying you in his arms; He had caught you and $medicName and forced each of you back into your cells, then probably wiped your memory again. As he dragged $medicName behind him she glared at me, which in retrospect is very strange. Anyways some time passed before your next attempt, which was maybe four days ago.
[$pName] I tried to escape twice already, as recently as four days ago!? I don’t remember anything…
[$bName] This must be hard for you, I’m sorry for getting so emotional about it earlier. I know it’s not your fault… So four days ago… ah right, four days ago you tried again. I remember faintly hearing $thiefName trying to explain everything to you yet again and being so patient, it must have really killed him to have to tell you everything over and over again. Especially because you probably treated him like a stranger… Anyways he even gave you two little pieces of metal he was going to pick his door lock with, trusting you to accomplish the mission in his stead. You managed to open the door but the pick broke, and he suggested you put the broken fragment into the door lock and hope that it kept it from locking in case you get imprisoned again. Then you disappeared into the Castle, by yourself this time. Surprisingly, you managed to find the keys and even get back without being discovered.
$bName crosses her arms, and purses her lips.
[$bName] What comes next was very difficult for me, since I didn’t know about your memory wipe. You proceeded to free every single person… except me. You even stood in front my cell for a second as if you were going to, but in the end you didn’t. I remember you kept looking at your left arm regretfully, it was the weirdest thing… 
She relaxes a little and paces around the cell again.
[$bName] The four of you came back a while later, $toughName holding Powell. Powell looked really hurt, and I was very worried. I tried to ask what was going on but everyone ignored me… how frustrating. You all were out of breath like you had just run away from something and retreated into your respective cells to recover and regroup. You spent some time in Powell’s cell, then talked to $thiefName for a while, and then the two of you were interrupted by FAMINE who had just returned. Everyone was locked back up, I’m assuming you had your memory wiped again, and that’s that. Nothing left to tell.
[$pName] Jeez. That’s a lot for me to process…
