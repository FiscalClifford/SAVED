You approach Powell’s cell and peer through the bars into the dark interior. Inside is solidly built man of average height laying on the ground with his back to you. There appears to be a pool of blood on the ground around him with bloody footsteps leading away and towards the cell door which surprisingly is slightly ajar.
[$pName] Powell?
The man doesn’t respond or even move at all. He is so perfectly still it doesn’t look like he is even breathing.
