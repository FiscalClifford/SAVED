Something about Powell’s situation doesn’t add up. Cautiously, you push the metal door open and its un-lubricated joints scream out at you in protest. You approach him carefully, making sure not to step in any of his blood. As slowly and respectfully as possible you gently ease him onto his back so that you can see his torso for the first time. Nothing of interest stands out to you, but there are bloody fingerprints and smudges all over his shirt which catch your attention. Following the trail of evidence, you slowly rip open his shirt to reveal Powell’s big secret: previously hidden underneath his shirt and carved across his chest are the words:
Arm Is LIE
It looks like in his final moments, Powell used his own knife to carve the letters into his chest. You take note of his final message, and with nothing else to see there leave the cell.
