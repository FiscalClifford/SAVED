Powell’s corpse lays on the stone floor unceremoniously. His body looks like it is in normal condition except for a massive gash across his neck, which must have been caused by the slice of a sharp weapon. There are no signs of blunt force trauma anywhere on his body. Next to his hand on the floor is his dagger, which is covered in his own blood. Surprisingly, the dagger has a thick blade and considering how precise the cut on his neck is it doesn’t look like the dagger was the cause of his wound. Judging by the amount of blood he must have spent his last few minutes struggling to survive here before bleeding out.
