You grab the Jail Cell Keys and place them into your pocket. They jingle merrily and you feel relieved to have gotten this far successfully. That feeling of relief doesn’t last long however, when you hear the heavy thudding of footsteps approaching from somewhere downstairs. You crouch low, and peer through the rails of the balcony banister.
Below you is a massive Golem that sends a chill down your spine. It is perhaps 8 feet tall and made almost completely of stone; it looks extremely tough and there is no way you could defeat it on your own. You stare down at it, paralyzed with fear, as it slowly patrols around the main hall. It almost feels as if it knows you escaped, and is looking for you. You hold your breath and try to hide yourself as best as you can. Finally, after what feels like ages, the footsteps recede as the Golem retreats back into the Castle for more patrolling in a different area. You breathe another sigh of relief and hope you never have to deal with that monster directly. Out of all of your allies in the jail cells the only one that would even have a chance of beating it is probably $toughName the burly fighter from cell two, and even then it’s not a for sure thing.
