[WAR] Wow still here? Alright then, I said I’ll do it so I will. Let me just install this virus and… 
Before either you or WAR can react a mighty roar blasts out from somewhere outside the castle, and an enormous explosion rocks the castle. Dust flies from the ceiling and stones from the wall topple out of their sockets.
[WAR] Ugh, not you!
The earth trembles and the deafening sound of the castle being destroyed rings out in your ears. The next thing you know the ceiling is gone, completely obliterated by the swipe of a massive scaled claw. 
WHAM
Before he can even react, The Ancient Dragon peers into your cell from above and stomps on WAR killing him instantly.
[$pName] …!
The Ancient Dragon is at least three stories tall, and covered in golden scales that sparkle with beauty. His mighty wings stretch magnificently through the air and then tuck away close to his body as he kneels down to face you. He is the most awe inspiring, incredible, and formidable beast you have ever seen.
*A Golden voice of deep Baritone gently reaches out to you at the edge of your consciousness*
[THE ANCIENT DRAGON] I have arrived at last.
[$pName] Of course you have, it is fate. It is Destiny.
