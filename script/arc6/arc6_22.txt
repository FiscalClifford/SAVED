Your eyes open. Somehow, against all odds, you are still not dead. In your soul you can feel you are very close however, and only have perhaps a few more moments of lucidity before everything fades away for the last time. You turn your head slowly to the side, towards where you hear a faint shuffling sound. You can’t believe your eyes. It is $bardName, dragging her dying body slowly towards you at a snails pace.
She cries faintly to herself as she slowly forces her small, frail body to push itself towards you. She looks so palid and delicate that a strong wind could pick her up and blow her away, never to be seen again. Finally after what feels like an eternity of struggling she manages to get within a few feet of you and sits criss crossed, blood dripping out of her mouth.
[$bardName] You lied… $pName…
The tears are pouring down her face, intermixing with the gobs of blood covering her chin and torso. She sways back and forth unsteadily, as if she doesn’t have the strength to even sit up straight. She probably doesn’t.
[$bardName] You promised… $pName…
[$pName] $bardName… I’m sorry…
[$bardName] you PROMISED $pName… that everything… would be ok…
[$pName] …
[$bardName] I’m going… to hell now… for killing… my father…
[$pName] No $bardName… no…
[$bardName] I’m going… to suffer…
[$pName] no…
[$bardName] suffer for eternity… Its what… I deserve… I suppose…
[$pName] $bardName… that’s not true…
$bardName is swaying back and forth violently now, hardly conscious enough to hold herself upright at all. Her eyes roll back in her head.
[$bardname] You promised…
She falls over, lifeless. $bardName is dead and you know deep down you will soon follow.
[$pName] …
You want to cry but you don’t have enough strength left in you to muster up the tears. You don’t have enough strength left for anything now. You cough up a wad of blood, but it doesn’t escape your mouth and clogs up your esophagus. You are far too exhausted, far too weak to do anything about it, and you slowly choke to death on your own blood. With a shudder you fail to get enough oxygen to your brain and everything shuts down. You are dead.
THE END
