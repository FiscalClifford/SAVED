Your eyes open. Somehow, against all odds, you are still not dead. In your soul you can feel you are very close however, and only have perhaps a few more moments of lucidity before everything fades away for the last time. You turn your head slowly to the side, towards where you hear a faint shuffling sound. You can’t believe your eyes. It is $liName, dragging her dying body slowly towards you at a snails pace.
She is covered in blood, and leaves a trail of it behind her as she crawls towards you inch by inch. Every tiny movement she makes causes more blood to gush from her body, every ounce of effort visibly ravages her with pain. She makes soft, whispered moans of pain every few seconds, but nonetheless she continues to progress towards you. Considering she might be even closer to death than you are, it leaves you speechless. Finally, she gets close enough to touch you and holds you in her arms. She is crying. Faintly, she whispers in your ear.
[$liName] $pName… you… promised…
She reaches back and pulls out a small knife she keeps sheathed at the small of her back. Bringing it around, she sacrifices the last ounce of energy she has left in her body to cut the ropes binding you. 
[$liName] Free…. Now…
[$pName] $liName…
Tears emerge from your eyes. She is tired, so tired.
[$liName] I… Love… You…
She holds onto you tightly, one last fleeting moment in the person she love’s arms before shuddering and passing away. $liName is dead.
[$pName] No…
Her effort was valiant, and the only thing that gave her the strength to free you was the power of her love. Despite this, you are still mortally wounded and have naught but a few seconds left in this world. You use them the best way you know how; you hug her tightly to your chest, and sob.
Seconds later, you die still holding her in your arms.
THE END.
