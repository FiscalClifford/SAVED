Your eyes open. Somehow, against all odds, you are still not dead. In your soul you can feel you are very close however, and only have perhaps a few more moments of lucidity before everything fades away for the last time. You turn your head slowly to the side, towards where you hear a faint shuffling sound. You can’t believe your eyes. It is $aName, dragging her dying body slowly towards you at a snails pace.
She makes her way over to you inch by inch until she is finally close enough to touch you if she reached out far enough, and collapses. You hear a pained whisper escape her lips, so faint it is hardly audible.
[$aName] Looks like… the adventure… is over, huh?
You stare back at her sympathetically. A pool of blood forms around her.
[$pName] It’s over.
[$aName] But we had… a good run… didn’t we?
Despite almost certainly being in excruciating pain, $aName smiles a little to herself and you notice a glimmer in her eyes.
[$aName] I’ll… never… forget you… thank…. You…
You say nothing. Tears are streaming down your face. Tears are streaming down hers. Both of you are dying.
[$aName] Maybe next time… you will keep… your promise…
$aName gives a final shudder, and falls over dead. You cough, and paw feebly at your wounds. Everything goes dark. 
[$pName] Next time… Will be different…
You gasp, and your lifeforce exits your body. You are dead.
THE END.
