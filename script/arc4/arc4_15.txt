You decide to do nothing, and watch the train gain more and more speed with a feeling of dread. The train hurtles down the parallel tracks at tremendous speed, but just before it hits the five people…
Poof!
You blink, and the entire situation has reset itself. The train is right back where it had started, and doesn’t move.
[???] Interesting. Pushing the man is no different from pulling the lever, yet as soon as you have to physically take responsibility for your decision you shy away from it. Time for the final stage of the trial then.
You take a deep breath.
[???] A train is hurtling down the tracks at incredible speed, too fast for the train to be able to brake in time. Tied to the track ahead are five thousand people of completely randomized age, race, gender, and position…
Five thousand people appear on the track ahead of the train, and it begins to move forward gaining momentum. So many people appear on the tracks and squirm in terror that you can’t even see where the line of bodies ends, it just goes on and on…
[???] In front of you is a fat man that you do not know. He is not aware of your presence or who you are. The only way to save the five thousand people is by pushing him into the tracks, and his mass will block the train from continuing. By doing so, he will certainly die. But by doing nothing, the five thousand people will die. 
As you mull over the question, a fat man of about your height appears in front of you. He is standing with most of his weight on one leg, so pushing him forward and onto the tracks would be easy.
[???] If you do not push this man an entire cities’ worth of people will die, several generations of growth  tossed to the wayside, and a plethora of traditions lost forever. You can save an entire society by merely pushing a single man. So, $pName, which will you choose?
