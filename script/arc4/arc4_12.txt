You reach for the lever, and pull it with all your might. With a loud click the mechanism responds to your action, and the tracks move slightly forcing the train to take the divergent path. The train hurtles down the parallel tracks at tremendous speed, but just before it hits the tied down man…
Poof!
You blink, and the entire situation has reset itself. The train is right back where it had started, and doesn’t move.
[???] Interesting. Time for the next stage of the trial then.
You take a deep breath.
[???] A train is hurtling down the tracks at incredible speed, too fast for the train to be able to brake in time. Tied to the track ahead are five people of completely randomized age, race, gender, and position…
Five people appear on the track ahead of the train just past where the tracks diverge, and the train begins to move forward gaining momentum.
[???] But this time there is no divergence in the tracks. There is only one path, the path towards these five people.
The divergence disappears in a puff of smoke.
[???] In front of you is a fat man that you do not know. He is not aware of your presence or who you are. The only way to save the five people is by pushing him into the tracks, and his mass will block the train from continuing. By doing so, he will certainly die. By doing nothing, the five people will die. 
As you mull over the question, a fat man of about your height appears in front of you. He is standing with most of his weight on one leg, so pushing him forward and onto the tracks would be easy.
[???] So, $pName, which will you choose?
