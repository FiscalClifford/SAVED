She looks to be about 15, and is bursting with youthful energy. She wears woven black pants and a too-big purple sweater, which hangs loosely off of one shoulder. At her waist is a long scarf of burlap that wraps around her many times and continues to do so all the way down to her hips before being tied up at the back. She wears no shoes, and her blonde braided hair swings across her back as she sings and leans side to side. The sound of her voice is peaceful but at the same time unsettling.
