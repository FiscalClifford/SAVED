You turn and head the opposite direction of Kingsbridge, which must eventually lead to the place called “Dottle”. With the cheerful sunshine lighting up the countryside around you and the grass dancing merrily in the breeze, you can’t help but feel your spirits lift a little. The path you walk on is slightly uneven, but has been trodden upon enough times throughout the years that there is no mistaking where it leads. Following it mindlessly, you start counting your steps to pass the time. One, two three…
The Oak Tree Looms ahead.
Three hundred and thirty two… and you’ve nearly made it. It is truly a magnificent tree, the trunk must be about 9 feet wide and the entire thing stretches around 70 feet into the sky. 
Enjoying a brief reprieve from the sun in the shade, you take a moment to lean against it and listen to the leaves whisper in the wind. You close your eyes.
Wheeeeoooow
A big gust of wind blows through causing the branches to wave about like a dancer swinging their arms and it makes a nostalgically comforting sound. You back away from the trunk, and look up. About ten feet above you is, interestingly, a wooden platform. Nestled over a branch with small planks nailed into the trunk to keep it sturdy, the platform is about 2 feet wide in a square shape. The construction is very fresh and a little bit of sawdust is still collected on the edges of a few planks. Whoever put this up must have finished only an hour ago or less, and then left. With the wind blowing as it is, it might be dangerous to climb up and inspect the platform, but it wouldn’t be impossible for you to attempt.
