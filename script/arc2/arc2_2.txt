You decide to head for Kingsbridge and begin plodding along the dirt road. The layer of dirt on top of the path is very light and thin thanks to the unforgiving sun, which means every time the wind picks up or you take a heavy footstep the dirt rises into clouds and clogs your breath. Luckily you make it to the brook rather quickly and manage to rinse your hands and face in the cool, refreshing water. The brook’s water looks relatively clear and safe to drink so you hazard a few sips to rejuvenate yourself.  A long ways away someone dressed in brown gathers water from the brook upstream, but they are too far to notice you and they turn to head back into town. As you lean in for one last sip, you notice your reflection. It’s you, of course, that stares back. But your hair is a little messy and your eyes look a little strained. Technically it should be bedtime by now for you but now you are in different time zone and will have to wait a bit longer than usual. Hmm, bedtime. Where will you sleep when it gets dark? Are there homeless shelters around here? These questions and more will hopefully be answered once you investigate Kingsbridge so you hop back on the trail.
The distance ended up being larger than it looked, but you still manage to approach Kingsbridge in good time. As you near the town you can make out some better details from before, and for starters it has no walls or natural defenses. The path leads straight into the town and a long ways away out the other side, so it is not populous enough to be considered a city. The buildings are certainly the strangest thing that jump out at you, since they look like something straight out of medieval England history books. Many on the outskirts are made of dried mud gathered around a grid of sticks, creating small uneven walls with straw thatched roofing. Further in, the majority of buildings are made of wood, and the not quite evenly spaced planks make for simple walls with little insulation. While these buildings are larger and sturdier, they are also unpainted and plain which makes the majority of the town look simple and uninspired. Towards the center you don’t quite have a perfect view but it looks like there are a handful of large, stone buildings dominating a central space, which is some sort of plaza. These stone buildings have a frame of wood but are lined with stone and are reminiscent of the popular renaissance house architecture styles sometimes seen back home. The path that you had been following splits off into streets seemingly at random and arc throughout the town, and appear muddier thanks to the dung, water, and other unseemly liquids the inhabitants absentmindedly pour across it. 
As you enter the outskirts of Kingsbridge you notice the sheer amount of poverty overwhelming the area. The mud structures you had seen before are filled with holes and teeming with rats, and not much further ahead you can see many of the wooden shacks share the same fate. The air is filled with the smell of refuse, forcing you to wrinkle your nose in consternation. As you take a few steps into the town, you see a handful of people lazing about inside their mud shacks eyeing you with curiosity. Whether male or female they all seem to be wearing what appears to be a potato sack, except there is no label of “russets” or “goldens” across the rough sown garb but some sort of scribbling in small font that you can’t read from a distance. They stare at you as you walk past with expressions of curiosity as well as scorn, so you decide it would be best to continue along without asking them anything. At this point you could continue along the path into the central plaza, or take a winding side path that detours to the southern part of the town on your left. Either way is well lit so you don’t feel like you are in any immediate danger, and both directions certainly share the same putrid smell.
