You patiently wait for the person in the back to finish moving things. Finally, the door behind the counter is opened and a young man of about 20 with plain black hair greets you with a smile.
[Man] Hello mister, welcome tah the History Room! Learn all about how Kingsbridge came tah be fer only a single Aureus.
[$pName] Nice to meet you, I was actually hoping I could just go in really quick and out again since I have no money. It’s important since I’m quite lost actually and…
The Man immediately changes his posture at hearing ‘no money’ and adopts a cold attitude. He interrupts you with a raised voice
[Man] Hold on there Mister, it took a lotta hard work tah get all this information together and I got tah feed myself somehow. If I let everyone who begged in fer free then I would be right out there in the streets beggin’ as well. Please exit tah way ya came, goodbye!
Upon saying ‘goodbye’ he firmly plants his hands on the counter, in a clear show that he wants you out. Not wanting to cause trouble you listen and make your way outside. Feeling a little stressed, you decide to wind down by spending a few minutes watching the clouds in the sky pass by. Eventually, you notice two very interesting people that catch your eye: The first is a woman that looks very intimidating in an incredible white cloak marching into the ‘Adventurer’s Gear’ Shop. The second is another woman but she is wearing a vivid yellow dress and an extremely long and thin blade is strapped to her back. Both look like main characters out of a fantasy novel. The first lady disappears into the shop rather quickly and you lose sight of her, but you notice the second walking around the plaza browsing the shops. There is a woman escorting the girl in the yellow dress you didn’t see before as well, which is comical because she is wearing the exact same dress in almost every way except lavender instead of yellow. The pair walk around for a while you stare stupidly, until they happen upon the spell book merchant you noticed earlier. The woman in yellow seems to get excited, and chats about something with the shopkeeper for quite a while. Eventually she hangs her head a little in disappointment, and the pair resume their browsing. Once they have looked at all the stalls they head off the plaza, perpendicular to the road you had come in on. It looks like they will eventually pass some kind of church, and you can barely see the top of the steeple from where you stand.
