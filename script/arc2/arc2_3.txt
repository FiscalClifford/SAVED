You make your way to the central plaza, trying to step around the piles of filth pooling haphazardly around the road. The closer you get, the nicer the buildings become and it looks like someone poured gravel across the pathway so it is at least somewhat sturdier and better kept than before. Finally, you enter the wide-open plaza and soak in everything as best you can. The scene is entirely alien; there are no electrical poles, concrete roads, or even glass windows within sight. The plaza itself is paved with slabs of stone, but there is little to no mortar between them so many jut out callously from the dirt and threaten a twisted ankle. The square is about half the size of a soccer field and surrounded at all sides by stone buildings. From these buildings crude wooden signs stick out like pointing fingers, advertising a variety of goods such as food, clothing, armor, ale, weapons, boots, prostitution, and more. Scattered about the inside of the plaza are a large gathering of rickety stalls where merchants sell assorted wares, snacks, and… Spellbooks? The people you pass along the way wear either clothing similar to the potato sacks you had seen earlier, or a colorful assortment of felt tunics and leather gear. everal of the wealthier looking shoppers look like they wear that same burlap sack the others from the shacks wore underneath their garments or have a patch of burlap sown onto their clothing. Wandering about the plaza, two more buildings catch your eye: One labeled ‘History room’ and another labeled ‘Adventurer’s Gear’. Both have plain entrances but the title is enough to pique your interest.
