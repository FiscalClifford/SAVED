You glance around at the plaza and see the same as before; the ‘history room’, ‘Adventurer’s Gear’ store, and a hodgepodge of other random shops and services. There is a decent crowd of people milling about around the plaza, most are dirty and wearing what appear to be burlap potato sacks. $merchantName ‘s stall is still nearby as well but it would be best not to bother with him anymore. What next?
