[$pName] You’ve got the wrong guy, sorry.
[Man] Oh sorry mister, ya were standing there with such authority I thought ya were tah guy judgin’ our work! Aight well have a good one then.
The man turns around and heads back to the site, muttering under his breath about how Kingsbridge workers are always tardy. Without any real direction to head towards, you begin to wander around the town. There are bakers and taverns and all kinds of interesting shops around, and there is an especially large amount of places selling, renting, and buying horses. It seems like the people of Dottle really love their four legged friends. Passing the time some more, you make casual conversation with a friendly weaver who tells you he dreams of one day weaving cloaks for heroes, and before you know it the sun begins to set. With a start, you realize you don’t actually have anywhere to sleep for the night and may have to sleep outside, on the ground.
Wandering around some more, you look desperately for some kind of quiet alleyway or abandoned lean-to shelter to use but even after searching for what feels like forever you simply cannot see anything suitable. Every single alleyway is kept relatively clear of debris and offers little shelter, and every single shack you come across already has so many burlap clad peasants crammed into it there couldn’t possibly be room for you. Eventually you find yourself at the outskirts of Dottle, and despite there being little cover there you resign yourself to sleeping underneath a tree. The leaves will hopefully protect you from rain somewhat if it comes to that, and it doesn’t smell too strongly of horse manure over here. Shivering, you fall into an uncomfortable and uneasy sleep.
The next day, you find yourself extremely hungry and in no better a position than the last. You continue to wander the town for the entire day, but nothing of note happens. You don’t find any significant charity either: there isn’t a homeless shelter or any kind of social program to help you at all, and every person you beg for help tells you to simply ‘bug off to the pastures’. There is a church towards the west end that helps at least; The monk there gives you a single potato each day to eat as well as a burlap sack to wear. Curiously, the burlap sack doesn’t have any logos on it but rather an entire description on how to teach someone to read, as well as a multitude of practice sentences and pictures. It looks like even the poorest here have taught each other to read thanks to these sacks they wear and the result is an impressively literate albeit powerless lower class, which you have now officially joined. The monk doesn’t just give you a potato either, but critical information as well: all the poor people in town work for the church raising horses in the pasture. The work is grueling, he warns, but as long as you keep the horses, stables, and fields clean then you won’t quite starve to death. Taking his advice you join the huge mob of people that care for the ‘holy pastures’, an enormous area to the north of town that raises hundreds and hundreds of horses. After a long day of hard work and a constant feeling of wasting away, you take shelter at the same tree and sleep uneasily until the next day. This continues for months, and you can’t help but wonder what strange turn of events led to such a tedious fate.
 Eventually one day in the middle of the winter, you return to the shack you had built up on the west side of town a month ago with planks of forgotten rotten wood you found laying around. Most of the peasants have large families or gatherings that they use for heat, but after all this time and suffering you are still alone, save for the weaver you occasionally talk to during breaks. You curl up on the floor and try to sleep but you are so cold you can’t. The wind is howling outside and it begins to lightly snow. A few more hours of this later and you realize you have to do something soon or you will die. Unfortunately, you are so weak from months of poor eating and hard work that you can hardly get up. Crawling, you exit your hut and weakly call for help, but it is too late. A single tear drops out of your eye out of self-pity before you finally succumb to the elements and freeze to death alone in the cold, unforgiving dirt.
THE END
