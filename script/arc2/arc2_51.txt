You find yourself in the middle of a large field. It is as if you have been teleported into another world. Warily, you stand up and look over your body in an effort to discover any injuries, but there are none. 
You are on a dirt path next to a wooden sign. The wooden sign reads in English ‘Kingsbridge’ and there is the number 3 next to it. Below that is another marker that says ‘Dottle’ and the number 14. Backing up, you see that all around this dirt path you are standing on is tall grass about 3 feet high that covers the rather hilly countryside about you. Following the path with your eyes you see it eventually leads past a small brook and to the faint outline of what appears to be a town. That must be Kingsbridge. Following the path the other direction you notice it winds across the hills and past an impressive looking Oak Tree. It continues downhill steeply from there so that you lose sight of it, but by squinting your eyes you can just barely see that the path reemerges further away and straight towards a rather dense looking forest.
The sun is blazing overhead now across the sapphire sky, and every so often a small tuft of cloud ambles in front of its gaze giving you a brief reprieve from the heat. You are wearing a plain shirt and jeans, and in your pocket is your phone. In your hand you hold the $food which somehow wasn’t lost in the confusion earlier. Your legs begin to sweat from being stifled by the jeans and you will likely need a drink of water soon. It’s time to figure out What to do next.
