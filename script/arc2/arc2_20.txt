You enter the door of the three story building, and the wooden floor beneath your shoes creak ominously. There is no furniture in this room at all, and since there are no windows on this floor it is a little dark as well. In the corner, several burlap sacks are piled up and filthy with mud. Ahead of you are the stairs leading to the next floor, which has several steps missing and nails jutting out haphazardly. You make your way carefully up the steps, freezing every time one of the wooden planks sounds like it is going to collapse and send you tumbling down. Once you finally manage to make it to the top, you turn to face the interior. There are two windows on this floor, so it is much lighter than the one below. Furthermore, it has a rug made out of stitched together burlap sacks and a table resting on top of it. A flimsy looking stool sits next to the table, and in the corner sits a box filled with potatoes. The woman with the boil at that moments turns a corner that presumably leads to the next flight of stairs, and looks at you with eager intent. She has a plain and dirty face, but unfortunately the boil dominates her features and gives her a sour look. She is wire thin and maybe only 5’4, with long unkempt black hair. She wears a simple burlap sack with holes cut out for the arms, and there is a large burlap pocket sown onto the front.
[Woman] Glad ya took me advice! Ya makin’ a fool ah yerself walkin around blasphememian like ya ‘ave been, ya should know better a that! Take this mister…
She pulls a small loop of burlap out from the pocket and hands it to you.
[Woman] It’s fer wearin like ah bracelet. Round ‘ere not wearin a bit ah burlap somewhere on ya is like sayin you aint a believer. Yer a believer right mister?
She hands you the loop of burlap and you slip your hand through it, wearing it around your wrist.
