You run as quick as you can towards the steeple of the church, eventually coming to a halt at the front door. Between gasps of air you scan the surrounding area, looking for a tale tell flash of yellow. Unfortunately you don’t find it, but you do manage to catch a glimpse of lavender going right around a corner up ahead and the chase is back on. As you approach the corner you slow down, and peek left around it so as not to expose yourself if they looked back. Your worries were needless however as the two have slowed down and are now chatting amiably with each other, joking around as they take another road. In this way you follow them, and they wander without any real purpose throughout the town while chatting away. With a pang you remember how you used to talk like that with your friends back home before this all started, but the memory is quickly forgotten. Eventually the cheerful pair make it all the way down to the southern part of town, and start looking for a restaurant to enter while you follow from about 75 feet apart. It doesn’t feel good to stalk like this but there hasn’t really been an opportune moment to introduce yourself yet. Yet again, the duo detour into an alleyway and you wait a second before following suit. This alleyway mazes around in a thin space between buildings, and you lose track of them. Jogging up to where the corners of four buildings meet and thus create a divergence in the alleyway, you glance to your right but see nobody. Turning, you check to see if they went the opposite direction only to see that they are standing right next to you in the alleyway, glaring angrily.
[Woman in Yellow] And just who the fuck do you think you are, stalking us like some kind of creep!?
You back up slowly and try to get a good look at them. The girl in yellow looks to be in her early 20’s and stands at about 5’4. She has gorgeous $aHairColor hair and glistening $aSkinColor skin. She wears a pretty yellow dress that ends just above the knee and underneath that dress is some thin but sturdy leather armor, cleverly hidden behind blue laces and bows. Her brown leather boots don’t quite match the dress since they go up past her knees and have a multitude of black buckles, and it is clear that while the dress is for looks the boots and armor hidden beneath it mean business. On her back is an extremely long and thin blade that hangs slanted across her back, with a sheath that is decorated at the top with a small burlap ribbon. The blade looks so long it must be about her height. Her pretty $aEyeColor eyes spark with anger at you, and her facial features remind you of an old childhood friend you used to have growing up.
Next to her is her partner, the lady in lavender. She looks to be in her early 20’s as well but slightly older. She is about 5’6 and is clearly in peak athletic form. She wears nearly identical apparel except the dress is colored lavender with white laces and bows instead. Her sword is slightly less slanted on her back since she is taller, but it looks comically long all the same. She has silky smooth $liHairColor hair and supple $liSkinColor skin. She is so beautiful that it takes your breath away, and her $liEyeColor eyes glow at you with lurid emotion. The only imperfection on her face is that over and through her right eyebrow is a small scar about two inches long that slices straight down parallel to her nose. Speaking of eyebrows, they are furrowed angrily at you and you remind yourself to stop gawking and start speaking up.
[$pName] Now hold on a second…
You begin to sputter out an excuse to explain yourself but you are almost immediately interrupted by a new voice coming from behind the two women.
[???] Wah hoh there! Three thick thorns in tah throes ‘o passion…
The pair of girls create a space between them so that each can face you and the stranger simultaneously, thus protecting their flank from attack. With a short hop, the figure draws within 15 feet and points a dagger at the three of you, waggling it aggressively.
[Man] Aureus! Give it tah me! Stop stalling and slip it ovah! I can tell by yer gaudy dressin’ yerv’e got some tah spare!
The Man wears a filthy burlap sack which drapes loosely over his wire thin body. An exceptionally long grey beard hangs like spiderwebs from his skeletal looking face, which is wrinkled up like a prune. A burlap cap struggles to keep purchase on his grey hair, which looks like it is falling out in disgusting clumps every so often. His belly sticks out grotesquely as if he was pregnant, and overall his appearance is strikingly disgusting.
[Woman in yellow] How about you wait your turn for a beating like a gentleman!
She roars this threat at the grotesque man while simultaneously stepping back and cowering ever so slightly. Her words are brave but her posture says otherwise, she must have been caught completely by surprise. Unshaken however is her partner, who deftly reaches behind her to the hilt of her blade and with one swift motion propels it up and out of its sheath. Waiting a short moment for gravity to bring the blade back down, she reaches back up and snatches it out of the air, quickly bringing the entire length of the gleaming sword pointing straight at the man.
[Woman in Lavender] Get Lost.
The man freezes, and grimaces of panic and desperation flash across his face. He must not have seen the two women were armed, and thinking the two pretty dresses meant an easy score ended up falling right into a trap. Unlike most traps however there was an easy way out, all he has to do is tuck his tail between his legs and run. To your astonishment however, he raises his dagger back up and at the woman in Lavender while not moving back an inch.
[Man] Ah Wish ah could! Kill me then! Ah dare ya just end it then!
His words wobble with pained emotion. Clutching the dagger with both hands, he closes his eyes shut and begins a blind charge. His feeble, thin body struggles to propel him forward at any threatening speed and he unsteadily attacks. The woman in lavender raises the wickedly sharp blade above her head, ready to bring it down as soon as the man gets within range. It is not to be however.
*SHHLIIICK*
[Man] Urk…
The man stumbles, gurgling  and coughing up blood from his mouth. Wordlessly, he looks up and stares to his left, where from another alley yet another figure has appeared. He then looks down, where his left arm is completely impaled by a sword. The blade doesn’t stop with his arm however; it has gone completely through and into his chest, likely impaling both lungs. He drops the dagger and turns his head to stare straight into your eyes dumbly as if he can’t believe what is happening. In the blink of an eye, the newcomer pulls the sword back dislodging it from the mugger and spins, bringing the sword around in a graceful arc. Mercifully it slices completely through the muggers neck in one clean slice, instantly decapitating him and painting the building behind him crimson. The body of the putrid mugger hits the ground wordlessly, spilling blood into the dirt.
The killer bends over slightly, wiping the blood off their sword onto the clothing of their slain foe, and with a practiced motion sheathes their blade. Stepping over the puddle of gore, she approaches the three of you with a smile.
