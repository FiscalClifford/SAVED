You ignore the platform in the Oak Tree and stretch your muscles a little bit before continuing along the path. The countryside around you is so vibrant with light and beauty that you can’t help but pull out your phone and take a quick picture. Your phone is getting low on battery so you do it quickly, but the photo still turns out great. 
There is a slight downhill a little past the Oak Tree and you find yourself making excellent progress. In a few places you have to hop slightly so that you can keep your balance, and the impact of your shoes on the dirt path sends small puffs of dust clouds wafting into the air.
When you were by the rickety wooden sign before, you could see the path lead into the forest. Now that you are closer to said forest, you see that there is actually a fork in the road; one path indeed leads into the forest, but another cuts left around the outskirts of the tree line. There isn’t a sign to let you know which path leads to where, and the path that leads left curves around the forest so that you can’t see what it actually leads to. In front of you, the path that goes straight into the trees is shaded by the treetops and surrounded by fauna. Loose branches and trunks covered in moss are scattered across the forest floor, and the chirping of birds adds a lively touch. Despite the serenity you see ahead of you, something at the edge of your subconscious gives you a sinking feeling, as if it was warning you of danger ahead.
