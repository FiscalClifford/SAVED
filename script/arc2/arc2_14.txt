You approach the counter where the shopkeeper is haggling, and wait patiently for him to finish. Eventually the customer leaves having purchased a helmet, and you are able to talk.
[$pName] Sir I’m afraid I desperately need a sword, any sword, but don’t have the money for it. It could be a crappy one rusting in the back, or maybe just a small dagger, but…
The Shopkeeper moves quick as a flash, putting his finger up to your lips and silencing you
[Shopkeeper] No money, no nothin. Leave ‘er bucko.
You fumble in your pocket, bringing out the $food you had stored there earlier
[$pName] Sir this is an incredibly rare and valuable delicacy from where I’m from, you have likely never tasted anything like it before. I will gladly trade this for any spare weapon you have lying around!
The shopkeeper takes the $food from your hands, eyes it all over and plays with the plastic wrapping. Raising the $food to his nose, he takes a big whiff and eyes you suspiciously.
[Shopkeeper] ah like alternah-tives other than potate more ‘en most, but ain’t worth a thing ‘er. Now scit scat on outa ‘er ‘fore I sic mah dog on ya.
The guard standing at the far corner of the room starts walking towards you, and it becomes clear it is time to leave. Looks like the $food isn’t exotic enough to be worth much here.
You exit the Gear shop through the door you came in, and return to the plaza. As you take a couple steps into the plaza to browse around some more your eyes are drawn to yet another very unique looking person; a confident looking woman in a yellow dress with a large, thin sword strapped to her back. There is a woman escorting the girl in the yellow dress as well, and interestingly she is wearing exactly the same dress in almost every way except it is the color lavender instead of yellow. The pair walk around for a while you stare stupidly, until they happen upon the spell book merchant you noticed earlier. The woman in yellow seems to get excited, and chats about something with the shopkeeper for quite a while. Eventually she hangs her head a little in disappointment, and the pair resume their browsing. Once they have looked at all the stalls they head off the plaza, perpendicular to the road you had come in on. It looks like they will eventually pass some kind of church, and you can barely see the top of the steeple from where you stand.
