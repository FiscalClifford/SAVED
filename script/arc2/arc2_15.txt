You approach the woman, the embroidered image of the wolf on her cloak grimacing at you as you near. You aren’t really sure what to say, but you know saying the wrong thing may end poorly for you. Before you can think of anything to say, she speaks out without turning in a commanding voice:
[Woman] What do you want? Seen a ghost?
She turns around to face you casually, the sheathed dagger she was inspecting in her right hand and her left resting on the pommel of her sword.
[$pName] This sounds kind of crazy, but I was teleported into this world and there’s a lot to explain… I need your help.
She stares at you amusedly for a few seconds, and you hold your breath. She seems to come to some kind of conclusion, and looks down in thought. The next instant, she whips her right hand out launching the small leather scabbard of the dagger at you forcing you to duck. As you lean down, she takes a single stride forward and deftly places a kick straight into your temple, which is easy to aim at with you leaning low. The kick is gentle enough to not injure you seriously, but all the same you go flying backwards into one of the tables and knock into it, sending a dozen tidbits of flasks and amulets tumbling down all over you. Dazed, you try to regain your bearings in anticipation for another attack but it never comes; the woman walks past you without even glancing in your direction and heads to the counter where she begins to purchase the dagger. You wobble to your feet to try and talk to her some more, but before you can get a word out the guard from the far corner grabs your arm and twists it behind your back, forcing you towards the door.
[guard] causin’ trouble fer a paying customer huh? Out with ya runt!
The guard flings you out the door and you land harmlessly in some soft, albeit disgusting mud outside. Standing back up, you wipe what dirt you can off and decide to clear out before the woman exits the shop and gives you a second beating. You don’t get far before noticing that across the plaza is a woman in a yellow dress with a large, slender sword strapped to her back talking to the spell-book shopkeeper. She is animated about something and talks excitedly, but after a few more exchanges looks despondent and leaves the stall. A second woman in a very similar lavender dress follows her. The pair make their way to your left, and it looks like they are heading towards a church in the distance.
