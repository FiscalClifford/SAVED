Backing up so that you can get a good running start, you face the tree trunk and lower yourself into a sprinter’s position. Launching with all your ability, you spring forward and rapidly gain speed until you approach the base of the tree. Jumping as hard as you can you fly into the trunk, and push off it with your other leg to gain even more height. In the end, the effort was pitiful and you hardly gain any height at all, but it is just barely enough to reach the lowest branch. You grasp at it and by channeling your inner spider monkey, barely manage to swing your legs up and grab hold. With an enormous effort you loop your leg around the branch and push up until you finally are sitting on the branch. Following this same pattern and making sure to rest often, you manage to climb several more branches and eventually find yourself at the platform.
The platform is resting on a branch, with two planks on either side nailed into it and connect to the base of the tree to keep it steady. The wood is freshly cut and smells wonderful, and you imagine it would be a comfortable spot for a picnic. Climbing up, you manage to sit on the platform and look around; the leaves obscure much of your vision however you have a perfect view of the path you just travelled down almost all the way up until the rickety wooden sign. Anyone who sits up here would be able to see travelers coming down that path well in advance, and would be completely hidden by the leaves of the tree. Furthermore, the platform is just barely wide enough for someone to kneel on it meaning anyone with exceptional balance would be able to shoot a gun or fire an arrow from here as well. If not for the platform, a tree branch would be too curved and unsteady for that purpose.
There isn’t much more to see here, and after picking at the nails a little bit you realize you won’t be able to do anything that would affect the platform unless you had a hammer. On your way back down you unfortunately manage to give yourself a nasty splinter, which stings your thumb as you lower yourself further. Finally, you get to the bottom and stumble back to the earth. With one last look at the Oak Tree, you pick at the splinter on your thumb and continue along the path east.
When you were by the rickety wooden sign before, you could see the path lead into the forest. Now that you are closer to said forest, you see that there is actually a fork in the road; one path indeed leads into the forest, but another cuts left around the outskirts of the tree line. There isn’t a sign to let you know which path leads to where, and the path that leads left curves around the forest so that you can’t see what it actually leads to. In front of you, the path that goes straight into the trees is shaded by the treetops and surrounded by fauna. Loose branches and trunks covered in moss are scattered across the forest floor, and the chirping of birds adds a lively touch. Despite the serenity you see ahead of you, something at the edge of your subconscious gives you a sinking feeling, as if it was warning you of danger ahead.
