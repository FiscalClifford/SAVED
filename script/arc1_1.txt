ARC 1, THE STORE

Outside the grocery store close to where you live, you decide to take an extra moment to appreciate the sunset. It has a particularly lurid haze of orange and maroon this evening, and it strikes you that it has been a while since you last saw such a pretty sight. Then again, you haven’t been outside as much as you’d like to lately so maybe enjoying something that isn’t a screen simply feels better than usual. You turn around, and head inside. The grocery store is about as average as it gets, with the usual bright lighting and manufactured cheer you would expect. Annoyingly, this one keeps the junk food a bit further from the front than most stores so you have to pass by quite a few aisles to get there. As you walk, you ponder whether you are in more of a sweet or salty mood tonight and realize that it’ll probably have to be a choice between chocolate or potato chips. “A person is nothing more than the sum of their choices” is a quote you feel like you heard somewhere before but you don’t quite remember when or who by. Anyways, time to choose.
