You dodge the attack just in time, jumping to the side as his blade narrowly misses your shoulder. You ready your sword for a counter attack but DEATH is too quick, and continues to pressure you with multiple deadly swings. You parry his attacks, but they rapidly get quicker and quicker. Next, he faints an attack from above but instead of swinging kicks you in the chest and sends you flying backwards, skidding across the icy floor. You stagger back up to your feet trying to catch your breath, but before you know it DEATH sprints towards you and slides low with his blade at the ready.
