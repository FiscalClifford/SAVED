You attempt to overcome DEATHâ€™s attack but you are too late, too sloppy, too underpowered compared to his immense ability. Death cuts you down and your destroyed, feeble body lays in a pool of blood on the icy floor. You have lost count of how many times it has happened now. Once again you have experienced DEATH.
THE END
