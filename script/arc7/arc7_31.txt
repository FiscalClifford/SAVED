FAMINE reverses in age by another 5 years and he shrinks into the form of a small 13 year old. He has the face and body to match the age, and this combined with his enormous belly makes for an incompatible situation. 
[FAMINE] AAAAGGGGHHHHH
FAMINE’s body can no longer handle the stress and his stomach explodes sending chunks of flesh violently soaring across the room. Blown in half, FAMINE’s torso flies upwards and spins through the air in an arc until finally returning to the ground in a sickening splat. He screams the whole way up and groans the whole way down, but on impact he simply cannot take it anymore and finally passes away. FAMINE is defeated.
You turn to check in on your friends, and notice they are all collapsed on the floor sleeping. Their chests move up and down gently and they dream of better things.
[$pName] They must not have been able to handle the monologue as well as I did and instantly collapsed from sheer exhaustion. Or perhaps it was a part of FAMINE’s magic? Either way it would be asking too much of them to hope they could continue so I guess It’s just me from here on out.
You carefully step around FAMINE’s gore as you pass the gruesome scene. Just like before, you march over to the stairs and take one last look back at your friends to make sure they are all ok. They sleep peacefully, undisturbed. You climb the steps.
