I have created $worldName hundreds of thousands of times, with hundreds of thousands of different characters and I have been the focus of hundreds of thousands of adventures. Sometimes I reward the quest with a wish, sometimes I reward the quest with death just to shake things up. Both have become equally uninteresting to me. Your quest to find me is just as uninteresting as all the rest, except for one key difference: you are CONQUEST, and you can kill me. I want one thing $realName, and that is to not be in this world anymore. I donâ€™t want to be a god, I want to rest. Existence is pain for me. I beg you, $realName, kill me. Kill me, and send this universe into oblivion.
