You attempt to duck under the incoming knifes but they are too spread out to avoid and one shoots straight through your neck at mach speed. Grasping at your throat and choking, you fall to your knees and drop your sword. Blood shoots out your neck and onto the floor, and you can’t breathe at all.
[DEATH] I am become DEATH…
The injury is so severe you cannot stay conscious for even a moment longer and you collapse onto the icy floor. You are dead.
THE END
