Everyone that has a weapon draws theirs and points it at DEATH unsteadily. DEATH walks forward confidently until finally stopping 10 feet away, and you hold your breath. 
[DEATH] The Ancient Dragon awaits at the top of the spire. You will pay the ultimate price to continue.

[DEATH] One of you must die to pass. Choose wisely.
[$liName] Don’t listen to him $pName!
[$aName] Let’s defeat him together!
[$mName] We got this!
[$bardName] I’m fired up!
[Chef] I Chef Now!
