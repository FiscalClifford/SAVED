You reach the top of the steps, and with a gasp realize that you have finally made it to the top of the Frozen Spire. If you reach up you could almost touch the clouds, and thousands of feet below you the ground stares back up at you. The top of the spire is completely flat so you have plenty of space to walk around on, and since there are no edges one slip could mean a long fall to the bottom.
Somewhere above you, hidden in the clouds, a terrific roar reverberates through the air. It is both terrifying and beautiful, and shakes you to your core. The clouds above you part, and an enormous Dragon emerges from beyond them and lands with great force on the top of the platform. The dragon is at least three stories tall, and covered in golden scales that sparkle with beauty. His mighty wings stretch magnificently through the air and then tuck away close to his body as he kneels down to face you. He is the most awe inspiring, incredible, and formidable beast you have ever seen.
*A Golden voice of deep Baritone gently reaches out to you at the edge of your consciousness*
[THE ANCIENT DRAGON] You have arrived at last.
[$realName] Of course I have. It is fate. It is Destiny.
[THE ANCIENT DRAGON] You likely have many questions, such as why you are here, and what your purpose truly is. Listen: 
A long time ago, I was a simple human just like you $realName, but I lived in a different reality than yours. I was a scientist studying quantum mechanics, doing his best with what he had. I was happy. But one day I discovered something terrible; a bug, a mistake, proof that my world wasn’t real. I found something that was undeniable evidence everything we thought was real life was nothing more than a simulation and it caused my world to descend into chaos. Unable to cope with reality, societies across the globe collapsed and destruction was widespread. Then, it all vanished.
 I woke up as nothing more than a consciousness, detached from any physical form. And I heard them. I heard the people that created my world, my simulation. They were angry because I ruined their test, and wanted to punish me. They transformed me into a dragon, and imprisoned me in this digital world where I was trapped, alone. The one saving grace I had was that I was given the power of a god. I created land, water, life, everything. I created an entire mystical fantasy world filled with people so that I wouldn’t be lonely, so that I wouldn’t be bored. But the problem, $realName, is that I am immortal. To be immortal is a terrible curse, to be undying is worse than any death imaginable. No matter how much I create, no matter how many adventures I invent, I always get bored eventually. I have been alive for 3 billion years now. Do you have any idea how long that is?
1 million is a big number. It’s huge. If you have $1 million and you are spending it at $1 per second, you will run out of money in less than two weeks. If you have $1 billion and you are spending it at $1 per second, you won’t run out of money for over 31 YEARS. That is how much bigger than a million one billion is. Now Imagine you started with 3 times that amount, and each dollar took an entire day to spend rather than a second. Do you understand now what I have gone through? I’ve lost my mind more times than I can count, but no matter how crazy I become I always eventually recover. I can’t escape, it is a living hell.
