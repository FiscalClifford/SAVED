You climb the stairs by yourself, and with every step you take you feel the power of your determination growing. At the top you find yourself in yet another room nearly identical to the last, except here the ceiling is even higher than the last one which makes the room appear to be huge despite not really being that wide. Through a window you can see that the ground is far below and that you are a considerable amount of the way up the Spire. At the far side of the room is another figure, this one even more intimidating than the last.
An imposing man in about his mid thirties stands with his arms crossed, waiting for you. You can see he is remarkably handsome, despite most of his face being covered by a thick black beard that extends about 2 inches below his chin. This beard dominates his face in contrast to his lack of hair since he is completely bald. He has piercing light blue eyes that are locked onto you, and are so penetrating it feels as if they can see into your soul. It’s clear by his expression that… He hates you.
The man has a clean pair of grey pants and a charcoal undershirt, with a sturdy leather cuirass over the top of that. Over his left shoulder is a large bronze pauldron with a neck guard that sticks up to ear level, securely strapped on by large strips of buckled leather over his chest and torso. Draped over his left arm and attached underneath the pauldron is a small cape of crimson that ends at his waist. A small glint of light reveals he is wearing bronze greaves over his shins. He carries no weapon that you can see. 
[???] As always, the script was correct and you have defeated the other horsemen. I pray, for the sake of all the people of this world, that I emerge victorious in this battle. Prepare yourself.
WAR approaches.
