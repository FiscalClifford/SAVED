You thrust forward with your sword and plunge it straight through FAMINE’s mouth, slicing his vertebrae and paralyzing him. He crumples backwards screaming and lands on his back hard. You twist, slicing his tongue off so that he can never say a word again.
[FAMINE] AAAGHGGGHHHUUUHHHHGGHH
You pull your sword out and bring it back down, and it shoots through FAMINE’s skull with a crunch. He is finally defeated. You turn to check in on your friends, and notice they are all collapsed on the floor sleeping. Their chests move up and down gently and they dream of better things.
[$pName] They must not have been able to handle the monologue as well as I did and instantly collapsed from sheer exhaustion. It would be asking too much of them to hope they could continue so I guess It’s just me from here on out.
You flick the blood off your sword and return it to its sheath with a flourish. Just like before, you march over to the stairs and take one last look back at your friends to make sure they are all ok. They sleep peacefully, undisturbed. You climb the steps.
