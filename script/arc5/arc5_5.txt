Glancing over your shoulder to make sure nobody is paying attention to you, you hastily make your way over to the manhole cover and peer inside. It is dark, but a torch at the bottom gloomily lights up the area so that you can barely see the ground. There is a ladder leading downward that you grasp, and clamber down.
Reaching the bottom, you take a look at your surroundings. You are in a small tunnel, about the size of a train. At one side is a small stream of refuse that smells terribly, but for the most part the tunnel is dry. A single torch lays on the ground forgotten, which you pick up and hold out in front of you. It is so dark that you canâ€™t see more than twenty feet in front of you in either direction. Time to explore!
