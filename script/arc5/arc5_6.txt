You make your way through the tunnel, careful not to trip on the numerous loose stones and cracked chunks of mortar lying around on the path. You can hear the sound of water rushing somewhere far off but it echoes off the walls in a way that you can’t find the origin of the sound. Before long you wander to a new section of the tunnel that breaks off into two different paths. One branches off to the left, and has piles of rubble stacked up along the sides. The other path leads to the right and has a small manhole cover over the ceiling with lets through a feeble amount of light. There isn’t much difference between the two other than that.
