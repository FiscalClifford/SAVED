You throw the door open and step inside, startling a cultist guard who must have been shirking his duties by napping next to the entrance. He jumps up as fast as he can, but before he can pick his sword up off of the ground you plunge your blade into his neck. He quietly drowns in his own blood for a few seconds before collapsing, and you are confident his pitiful gurgling didn’t make enough noise to alert anyone. 
It’s the first time you have killed anyone. You don’t feel particularly accomplished, after all you were only doing what needed to be done. At the same time however you do feel a little satisfied all your training thus far wasn’t a total waste of effort; perhaps you are getting stronger after all.
After wiping the blood off of your sword you take note of your surroundings.
You are in a small reception area with several chairs and a painting of a dragon breathing fire on a town, sending the inhabitants screaming in all directions.  Fluffy red pendants and draperies adorn the walls and a few of the chairs. There are two pathways that likely lead to the main area of the cathedral, and a single staircase that leads to some kind of second floor observation balcony.
