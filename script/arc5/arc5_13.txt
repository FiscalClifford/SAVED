The 18 or so cultists reach into their fuzzy robes as you charge forward and draw a uniquely varied array of weaponry to point at you. Some have sickles, some have jagged daggers, but all have deadly intent to stop you. Holding your sword above your head, you bring it down with all your might towards the closest cultist but he dodges backwards just in time to avoid it. At the same time, another cultist makes his move to attack your left flank while you are vulnerable and you only barely manage to bring your sword around and deflect his blow. Meanwhile, Chef bullishly charges forwards into the center of the fray while hurling his massive cleaver about him in a deadly assault. The cleaver has such tremendous momentum by the time it reaches each cultist that no matter how hard they try to dodge they cannot escape, and even if they attempt a parry their weapons are instantly shattered by the impact. 
You square off against the cultist who tried to flank you and prepare to strike. The cultist is no older than 17 and displays an indignant delirium only someone completely brainwashed could have. His head is completely shaven and his fuzzy robe loosely covers his rib lined chest, which for a moment makes him look so pitiful you hesitate to attack. This hesitation is immediately punished however when with a bloodcurdling scream the cultist lunges towards you and you just barely manage to leap to the side and avoid his attack. In retaliation you attempt a lunge of your own but the cultist narrowly dodges as well and prepares for another swing. In his hand is a long and thin short sword with no guard, and you can see the whites of his knuckles gripping it tightly. His eyes narrow, and he lunges again. You attempt a parry but your form is sloppy due to the adrenaline coursing through you and you only manage to barely tip his weapon to the side while stumbling away. He keeps up the pressure, and you quickly find yourself fighting for your life.
Meanwhile, $liName and $aName spring their trap and attack the cultists from the rear. In a hurricane of bladework and deadly assault the two cut down eight or so within the span of seconds, and it is only after two more are swiftly chopped down that the ArchBishop finally notices and raises the alarm to the ambush. $liName and $aName’s synergy is perfect, and they attack and defend for each other in excellent coordination.
You have no opportunity to appreciate their success as you are busy keeping the young cultist at bay. You have a reach advantage thanks to your sword being longer, but the cultist rushes at you in a blood frenzy and closes the gap immediately. You both swing at the same time, and instinctively grab the other’s sword arm with the free hand and find yourself locked in a struggle to control the other’s attack. If you focus on your sword arm you might get free and get a hit in, but that would leave you open for attack as well. If you focus too much on the other arm and disarm him, you likely will lose control of your own weapon. The two of you twist and pull on the other unable to gain an advantage for what feels like years until finally Chef reappears behind you and cleaves the cultists arm clean off, freeing your sword from his grip at last. The cultist shrieks at Chef angrily, as if he is accusing him of ruining the duel. Continuing to hold his sword arm as hard as you can, you bring your weapon back and then forwards with all your strength and impale the helpless cultist straight through the heart. He stares at you with hatred in his eyes for a second before collapsing to his knees and falling over, dead. By the time you look around you to thank Chef, he is already gone and attacking a new pair of cultists.
You march towards the ritual circle once again to help but by the time you arrive it is too late, all the cultists are either dead or defeated. Only the Archbishop remains, cowering in the center of the ritual circle. He wears a white fuzzy robe with a golden chain draped across it, three human skulls dangling from its links. Splattered across the pale whiteness of the robe is the gore from his sacrifice, and his shoulder length black hair is soaked in it as well. He is surprisingly handsome and has amiable features, the exception being his sharp orange eyes which appear to glow in the torchlight of the ritual circle. An aura of evil emanates from him.
[ArchBishop] Typical heretic behavior, resorting to violence so quickly. You’re just like the mainstream church, childish and brutish beyond compare. How dare you!
[Chef] I CHEF NOW.
Chef stomps up to the Archbishop and wallops him in the stomach, forcing the maniac to double over in pain. You have a feeling if Chef used his full strength there instead of holding back, his fist may have been able to go straight through the man.
[$aName] $pName told us all about your scheme to sacrifice these innocent people and looks like we caught you in the act too. What do you have to say for yourself!?
[$liName] There’s no point $aName, it’s gonna be some bullshit about…
[ArchBishop] Don’t… *cough* don’t you understand they want it? They crave to be sacrificed!
The Archbishop looks up from the ground with a crazed look in his eyes, locked onto $aName with an uncomfortable intensity.
[ArchBishop] By giving their blood to me, they achieve what most cannot: salvation! By halting our prayer, you have ruined their chances of true freedom! How dare you!?
[$liName] Shutup, I don’t want to hear your worthless lecturing. What the hell is the cult doing in the Capital Cathedral?
[Archbishop] The Chosen Ones have little fingers in the affairs of all who live in this world, you know. The mainstream garbage is nothing but a puppet we keep around out of convenience. They, like you and I, all have our role to play. And my role ends tonight, as foretold…
Unsteadily, the ArchBishop rises to his feet, and hugs himself tightly.
[Archbishop] reeeeeEEEEEEE!!!
[$bardName] Watch out, it’s a control word!
[$liName] Quick $pName, Save the Game!
[$pName] What?
[$liName] What?
Suddenly, the blood covering his head and robes rapidly disappears and absorb into his body, causing it to glow a faint red. The Archbishop triumphantly roars and visibly grows in size a couple inches. Not only that, he seems to completely recover from Chef’s punch and even gain strength.
[Archbishop] The dragon himself has given me this power, is it not fate, is it not the Dragon’s will to use it? DIE! reeeeeEEEEEEE!!!
The dead cultists, whose bodies were lying motionless only a moment ago across the floor, suddenly fidget and convulse rapidly as blood pours out of them and gathers in pools. These pools then move with incredible speed towards the Archbishop, who absorbs the blood straight through his body.
[ArchBishop] BEHOLD THE DRAGON’S WILL!
The Archbishop floats several feet into the air now, curling up into a tight ball as he absorbs the cultist blood. Far away, you can hear the screaming of the trapped civilians as they witness the grotesque transformation. Finally, after all the blood has been absorbed, the Archbishop extends his limbs out and releases a shockwave, sending you and the others several feet backwards. His transformation is complete; his skin is completely red, like a demons, and within his eye sockets are literal balls of fire whose flames extend outward demonically. His body has now doubled in size and is now large enough to make even Chef look short, and a pair of Dragon’s wings extend from his back. His voice becomes so deep, so guttural, it sounds like it is echoing off the halls of hell itself.
[ArchBishop] TIME TO DIE
Putting both his hands together, he unleashes a fiery inferno from his palms like a flamethrower that completely engulfs the room. First he directs it at $aName, who has no time to react and is quickly completely incinerated. Within seconds her torched bones scatter across the floor leaving no trace of her existence behind.
[$liName] Save The G…
The flames are directed at $liName next, who is completely obliterated by the destruction of the demonic flames. 
Sensing the need to do something quickly, Chef charges forwards and cleaves at the ArchBishop, who opens his wings and flies up and into the open air of the Cathedral to dodge his attack. Like a fighter jet strafing an enemy, the ArchBishop turns and soars back down, unleashing hellfire onto Chef and melting him into a pile of bones and oozing flesh. Behind you, $bardName and $mName scream hysterically as they run for their lives. Frozen, you don’t move a muscle as the ArchBishop finally turns to you.
[ArchBishop] HAHAHAH! YOU WILL NEVER REACH THE FROZEN SPIRE NOW! DIE!!!
[$pName] Frozen Spire…?
The last thing you feel before succumbing to the flames is the strange taste of your own flesh as it rapidly cooks and melts down your throat. Weakly, you crumble into dust.
THE END
